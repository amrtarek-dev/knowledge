# What is IoT?
IoT is an extension of the internet into the physical world
Connecting everyday things embedded with electronics, software and sensors to the internet enabling them to collect and exchange data.

## What things mean?
Things in IoT domain means latterly anything like, we can connect your house keylock to the light to the AC and you can still manage all of them via platform.

## Why do we need IoT?
We need IoT to expand our interdependence to interact, contribute, and collaborate to things around us. 


## IoT is segmented by:
- B2C-Busnies to Customer IoT
	- Consumer
- B2B-Busnies to Busnies IoT
	- Commercial
	- Industrial
	- Infrastructural

## IoT products
- Smart (It is only an Embedded device that is alone does not create much value)
- Connected (Which just for ex your washing machine to your smart phone)
- IoT (Which is the device that utilise the Internet)

## Business View
The business view of IoT data segmented into few parts depends on either collecting data or transforming it into useful information.
- Software-defined product
- hardware-defined product
- Network fabric
- External system interface


### Software-defined product (SDP)
is both the heart and the brain of the IoT product, it is the virtual representation of the physical product. so some times it called the digital 
It consisted of 2 models:
- The Cyber Model
- The Application
