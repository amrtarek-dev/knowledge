There are 4 stages for integrating the different IoT processes

## Stage 1
Networked things (wireless sensors and actuators)

## Stage 2
Sensor data aggregation system and analog-to-digital data conversion or ADC

## Stage 3
The appearance of edge it systems to send the data to the network (analytics, pro-processing)

## Stage 4
Analysis management and storage of data.

As these stages are evolving the devices the network and the cloud application must be leveled equally in ecosystem for better stability and security.
