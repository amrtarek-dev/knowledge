A **Model** in Odoo represents a single business entity or concept, such as a product, customer, order, or invoice. It is a Python class that defines the structure (fields) and behavior (methods) of the data. Models correspond to database tables and encapsulate business logic

Models are Python classes that represent database tables and encapsulate the business logic associated with those tables. 

Odoo provides a powerful **ORM** (Object-Relational Mapping) system that allows developers to interact with the database using Python objects rather than writing raw SQL queries.

## Types of Odoo Models:
- Basic Models (for most of your data storage and business logic)
- Transient Models (for temporary data, like wizards)
- Abstract Models (for shared logic without creating database tables)
- Base Models (provide core functionalities but are typically not directly inherited)
- Automated Actions Models

### Basic Model (`models.Model`)
This is the standard model type used for most business logic and data storage. It inherits from `models.Model`.

``` python
from odoo import models, fields

class MyModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'my.model'
    _description = 'My Model'

    name = fields.Char(string='Name', required=True)
    description = fields.Text(string='Description')
```

#### Transient Model **(`models.TransientModel`)**
Transient models are used for temporary data, often in wizards (dialogs that guide users through a multi-step process). Data in transient models is automatically deleted after some time.

``` python
from odoo import models, fields

class MyTransientModel(models.TransientModel):
    _name = 'my.transient.model'
    _description = 'My Transient Model'

    name = fields.Char(string='Name', required=True)
```

#### Abstract Model (`models.AbstractModel`)
Abstract models are used as base models that other models can inherit from. They do not create database tables.

``` python
from odoo import models, fields

class MyAbstractModel(models.AbstractModel):
    _name = 'my.abstract.model'
    _description = 'My Abstract Model'

    name = fields.Char(string='Name')
```

#### **Base Models (`models.BaseModel`)**

All models in Odoo ultimately inherit from `models.BaseModel`, but you typically don't directly inherit from it in your modules. It provides the core functionality for all models.

#### **Automated Actions Models (`models.Model` with `ir.actions.server`)**

These models are used to define automated server actions. They can execute Python code, send emails, or perform other tasks based on certain triggers.

## Components of Odoo Models:

### Fields
Fields define the structure of the data stored in the model.

- `Char`: Character field, stores text.
- `Text`: Long text field.
- `Integer`: Integer field.
- `Float`: Floating point number.
- `Boolean`: Boolean field (true/false).
- `Date`: Date field.
- `Datetime`: Date and time field.
- `Many2one`: Many-to-one relationship field.
- `One2many`: One-to-many relationship field.
- `Many2many`: Many-to-many relationship field.
