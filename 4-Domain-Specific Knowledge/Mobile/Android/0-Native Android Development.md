There are 3 different ways that we can bring functionality to Android users:
- Responsive Web
- Hybrid
- Native
## Responsive Web
Simply take a web page and rearrange its content so that it can be viewed on a mobile device more easily, While you gain speed by only having to write web code that deploys across all platforms, you lose easy access to many Android‑specific features like location services, notifications, and an icon shortcut on the device itself. 
Of course, there are ways to replicate some of this functionality, but it's definitely not smooth.

## Hybrid
hybrid development approach, such as React Native or Xamarin. Here you take a language that you're already familiar with, such as JavaScript or C#, respectively, and write code in that language. 
The framework then compiles your code to native code for either iOS or Android. 
You get access to the native APIs, but are dependent on the framework to roll out the bridge to them. 
This can cause delays in adopting new platform‑specific features.

## Native
With native code, we're writing specifically for the Android platform and only the Android platform. 
This allows us to access everything the platform has to offer with the drawback that our code doesn't work on desktop or iOS like a responsive web codebase would.

## Kotlin
Kotlin is its own completely separate language from Java, While the syntax is similar, neither Java nor Kotlin depend on each other.
However, both Java and Kotlin compile down to bytecode for the Java virtual machine, making them completely interoperable.
So you can still use libraries written in Java in your Kotlin app and vies verse.

Kotlin has learned quite a bit from its predecessors. With this comes quite a few benefits like:
- Conciseness: Kotlin code is far less verbose and more concise than comparable languages like Java or C#, This allows you to write cleaner, simpler code that is easier to read and helps you deliver more value faster.
- Null Safety: Null pointer exceptions are one of the most common programming issues developers face, and Kotlin addresses them explicitly.
- Functional programming: improve the stability and performance of our code
