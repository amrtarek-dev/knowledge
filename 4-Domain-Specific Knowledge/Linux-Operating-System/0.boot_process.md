The Linux boot process is the first step to understanding the normal behaviour of the operating system including the bootloader, init process, and the Linux run-level.

So once you start your machine the boot process will start and it splits into some phases.

*   Hardware
*   Bootloader
*   Linux kernel

## Hardware

It will depend on your machine or board, but normally it is a phase when the hardware check for what is connected to it like (Basic input-output system (BIOS)), or even UEFI, then this phase will end by giving the handover to the storage device which attached to the board to start the bootloader process.

## Bootloader

It is the first software piece that will be loaded from the disk (Master boot loader (MBR), if you have a Hard disk), it is responsible to load the OS kernel or make you choose between multiple OS that you already installed, there are several types of a bootloader like GRUB for desktop, and u-boot for embedded systems.

## Kernel

it is the lowest level of software that interfaces with the hardware on your system, and it is responsible for interfacing all of your applications that are running in user mode down to the physical hardware and allowing processes to get information from each other using inter-process communication (IPC).

### Init process

The Init process (initialization process) is the first process that the kernel runs to start the other process, so it takes PID (Process ID) = 1, it reads the /**etc/inittab** file to determine the behaviour of each Linux run-level, which are 7 modes.

### Linux run-level

| Run Level | Mode |
|:----------------:|:--------- |
| 0 | Halt (Shut down) |
| 1 | Single user (allow only root login and does not load any network configuration or daemons). |
| 2 | Multi-user (allow multi-user, but still does not load any network configuration or daemons).|
| 3 | Mult-user with network and daemons |
| 4 | Not used (Need user definition) |
| 5 | X11 (Multi-user + display manager (X)) |
| 6 | Reboot the system |
