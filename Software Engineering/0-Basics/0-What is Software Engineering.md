## Software Engineer vs Software Developer
Software engineers are also developers, but the term `software developer` is usually deemed narrower in scope than that of a software engineer.
Software engineer knowledge is usually broader, he uses systematic development process to build entire systems whereas software developer use their knowledge to write code to implement specific functionality.
Software engineers responsibilities include writing and testing code, and consulting with stakeholders such as clients, third party software vendors, security specialists, and other team members.

Developer is narrower in scope than Software engineer.
Developer write code to implement specific functionality and solve specific problem.

Software engineer designing, building, and maintaining software systems.
- Writing and testing code.
- Consult with stakeholders, third party vendors, security specialists, and other team members.
