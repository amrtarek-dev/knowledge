## Waterfall model

``` markdown
-| Requirements
--| Design
---| Development
----| Testing
-----| Deployment
------| Maintenance
```
It is series of phases and once the phase finished we take the next.

It is not flexible, if there is a new requirements you will start the model from beginning.

## V-Model

``` markdown
Developer's Life Cycle.  Tester's Life Cycle
-| Business Req. Specs -----> Acceptance Testing
--| System Req. Specs  ----> System Integration Testing
---| High Level Design ---> Component Testing
----| Low Level Design --> Unit Testing 
-----| Coding | ----
```


## Agile Methodology

``` markdown
.       -> | Plan |->| Design |
           /                   \
 | Review |                     | Develop |
           \                   /
 Launch <- | Deploy |<-| Test |
```

It works in sprints which always start with plaining for the new requirements, then design, develop, test, deploy the small feature, then takes the new features in prints until launching.
