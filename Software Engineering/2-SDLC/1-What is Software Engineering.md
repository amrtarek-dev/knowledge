Software engineering is the application of scientific principles to the **design** and **creation** of **software**.
By using a systematic approach to collect and analyze business requirements in order to design, build, and test software application to satisfy those business requirements.

## Software Engineer vs Software Developer
Software engineers are also developers, but the term `software developer` is usually deemed narrower in scope than that of a software engineer.
Software engineer knowledge is usually broader, he uses systematic development process to build entire systems whereas software developer use their knowledge to write code to implement specific functionality.
Software engineers responsibilities include writing and testing code, and consulting with stakeholders such as clients, third party software vendors, security specialists, and other team members.

## SDLC
Today the development process is typically guided by the **Software Development Lifecycle** or SDLC.
It is a systematic process defines the steps needed to develop high-quality software in a predictable timeframe and budget.

It is a cycle of planning, design, and development that can be implemented as an iterative approach to software development.
- It improves efficiency and reduce risks
- Team members know what they should be working on and when.
- Facilitates communication among stakeholders.
- Team members know when development can move to the next phase.
- Iterative way enables respond to changing requirements.
- Solve problems early in the process
- Reduces overlapping responsibilities.


### 6 Phases of SDLC:
1. Planning
2. Design
3. Development
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

#### 1. Planning Phase:
In this phase the requirements are gathered, analyzed, documented, and prioritized, with consideration of users of the solution, purpose, data input/output, regulations & compliance, Risk Identification, Quality assurance requirements, allocation of human and financial resources, and project scheduling.

The Output of this phase is a software requirements specification (SRS) which where the requirements are documented in, and all stakeholders must agree

SRS categories:
- Functional: Functions of the software
- External & user interface: Users and interactions with other hardware or software.
- System features: Functions of the system
- Nonfunctional: performance, safety, security, quality.


#### 2. Design Phase:
In this phase the requirements are gathered from the SRS to develop an architecture by breaking down requirements into sets of related components.

The Output of this phase is the Design document.

#### 3. Development Phase:
some times it called Build, or implementation phase.
In this phase the project planner uses the Design document to determine and assign coding tasks, and the development team implement the system.

#### 4. Testing
The code is tested to ensure stability, security and that it meets requirements from the SRS.

The output is usually a Bugs reported, tracked, fixed, and retested by:
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- System testing
- Acceptance testing

#### 5. Deployment Phase

Once the project passes the User Acceptance Testing (UAT), the software is released on the web or app store.

#### 6. Maintenance Phase
It happens once the code has been deployed into a production environment to fond any other bugs, identify user interface (UI) issues, and identify other requirements that may not have been listed in the SRS.
If bugs are discovered in this phase that were missed during testing, these errors may need to be fixed for high-priority issues or incorporated into the requirements as part of a future software release and the process can start again.
