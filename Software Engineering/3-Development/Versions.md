Software versions tell us a lot about programs and applications.

Version numbers indicate
- when the software was released.
- when it was updated
- if any minor changes or fixes were made to the software.

Software developers use versioning to keep track of new software, updates, and patches.

## Version numbers
can be short or long (2, 3, and 4 sets).

alpha and beta version could has version number lower than 1.

v0.9 -> beta version.
v1.0 -> indicate first release with no update, patches or fixes.

can use semantic numbering, Major.minor.patch.build format, 
or date like Ubuntu
18.04.2 -> 2018 April with 2 fixes

## Compatibility
backwords compatible software functions properly will work with older version of software files, and systems.
