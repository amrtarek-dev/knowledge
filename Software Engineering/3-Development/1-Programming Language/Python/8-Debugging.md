The practice of identifying and fixing errors in code

There are 3 types of errors:
- Syntax errors: invalid usage of python language
- Logic errors: produce unintended results (Use Print, or debugger with breakpoints) 
- Exceptions: when the program does not know how to execute code
	- Mathematically impossible 
	- Access out of boundaries
	- Wrong data type
	- Use undefined variable or a function
