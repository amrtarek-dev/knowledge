### Requirements gathering
Is a 6 steps process of defining a problem to be solved and documenting how to go about solving that problem.
- Identifying stakeholders
	- Decision-makers, End users, System administrators, Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Customer support.
- Establishing goals and objectives
	- Goals: A broad, long-term achievable outcomes.
	- Objectives: more specific than goals (actionable, measurable) Actions that achieve the goal.
- Eliciting requirements from stakeholders
	- This could be iteratively
	- Elicit by Survey, Questionnaires, Interviews.
- Documenting the requirements
	- Align with goals and objectives
	- Easily understood by stakeholders and the product team.
- Analysing and confirming the requirements
	- To confirm the requirements it should have:
		- Consistency
		- Clarity
		- Completeness
- Prioritising
	- Must-have
	- Highly-desires
	- Nice to have

### Requirements documentation:
- Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- User Requirements Specification (URS)
- System Requirements Specification (SysRS)
#### SRS
Software requirements specifications is the process of collecting and documenting the set of requirements that the software needs to adhere to.
It may include a set of use cases that describe the business needs and user flows that the software must implement.

Captures functionalities that software should perform.
- Purpose and scope.
	- Who has access to SRS, How it should be used.
	- Software benefits, Goals, and Objectives
- Constraints, assumptions, dependencies.
	- How the product must operate under given conditions.
	- Required OS or hardware
	- Dependencies on other software to function.

SRS  are 4 Requirement categories:
- Functional: Functions of the software
- External & user interface: Users and interactions with other hardware or software.
- System features: Functions of the system
- Nonfunctional: performance, safety, security, quality.

#### URS
User Requirements Specification is describe business need and end-user expectations.
User requirements are written as **User stories** or use cases that answer 3 questions:
- Who is the user ?
- What is the function that needs to be performed ?
- Why does the user want this functionality ?

User acceptance testing determines if these requirements have been met.

> Often the URS is combined into the SRS.

#### SysRS
System Requirement Specification it is broader in the scope of SRS. Many software application develop SRS rather than SysRS.
It contains:
- System capabilities
- Interface and user characteristics.
- Policy
- Regulations.
- Personnel requirements
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements.
- System acceptance criteria.
- Hardware expectations.
