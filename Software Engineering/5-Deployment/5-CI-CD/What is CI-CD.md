Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are essential for modern software development.
They help teams deliver software faster and more efficiently.

CI/CD automates the entire software release process, from code creation to deployment. This automation is what enables modern development teams to be agile and respond quickly to user needs.

## CI (Continuous Integration):
it is all about frequently merging code changes from different developers into a central location. 

This triggers automated processes like building the software and running tests.

## CD (Continuous Delivery)
it means your code is always ready to be released to users.

After passing automated tests, code is automatically deployed to a staging environment (a practice environment) or prepared for final release.

## CD (Continuous Deployment)
it automates the entire release process.

Changes that pass all automated checks are automatically deployed directly to the live production environment, with no manual approval. This is all about speed and efficiency.
