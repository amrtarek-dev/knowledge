The process of finding and patching vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability
Vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat

### Exploit
Is a way of taking advantage of a vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Management
It's a method of stopping threats before they can become a problem.
it is a four steps in cycle:
1. Identify vulnerabilities
2. Consider potential exploits of those vulnerabilities
3. Prepare defenses against threats.
4. Evaluate those defenses.

### Zero-day
An exploit that was previously unknown

## Secure CI/CD
Continuous Delivery and Deployment can actually enhance security.

In CD allows you to build security checks right into your deployment pipeline. 
This ensures that only thoroughly vetted software versions are released.
These automated security checks can include:

- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Automated tests that find vulnerabilities in running applications in realistic staging environments.
- **Security Compliance Checks**: Automated checks that ensure software meets your organization’s security rules and policies.
- **Infrastructure Security Validations**: Checks that make sure the systems hosting your software are secure.

### CI/CD Vulnerabilities
1. **Risks from Third-party code**
If these components have known vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, or CVEs), those vulnerabilities can be unknowingly added to your application during the automated build process.
- Regularly scan and update your dependencies. Make sure you’re using secure versions of all external components.

2.  **Misconfigured Permissions: Controlling Access**
Unauthorized access can allow attackers to modify code, pipeline configurations, or inject malicious content.
- Implement strong access management using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Ensure only authorized individuals can access and change critical pipeline elements.

2. **Lack of Automated Security Testing: Missing Critical Checks**
Without tools like SAST and DAST, 
Static/Dynamic Application Security Test
you are almost guaranteed to release software full of vulnerabilities that will go undetected until after it's live, leading to significantly higher costs and effort to fix.
- Integrate automated security testing (SAST and DAST) into your CI/CD pipeline. This should be a core part of your secure CI/CD strategy.

### Defense in depth
A layered approach to vulnerability management that reduces risk (The castle approach) by reducing the attack surfaces.

It's a security approach that protects assets by surrounding them with multiple layers of protection.
It is using 5 layers design strategy:
1. Perimeter layer (User authentication layer (username and password))
2. Network layer (network firewall and others)
3. Endpoint layer (devices on a network, like laptops, desktops, or servers)
4. Application Layer (security measures as part of an application) like (software that users interact with, multi-factor authentication).
5. Data layer (critical data must be protected) (asset classification) (any information that’s stored, in transit, or in use)

### Exposure
Is a mistake that can be exploited by a threat

### CVE List
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list.

An Openly accessible dictionary of known vulnerabilities and exposures.
Created by MITRE

### MITRE
A collection of non-profit research and development centers.

### CNA
CVE Numbering Authority
An organization that volunteers to analyze and distribute information on eligible CVEs.

CVE List criteria:
- Independent of other issues
- Recognized as a potential security risk
- Submitted with supporting evidence
- Only affect one codebase

### NIST National vulnerabilities Database

Uses CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring system) which is a measurement system that scores the severity of a vulnerability.

It is scale of 0 to 10
- below 4 is low risk
- above 9 is critical and need patch asap

### OWASP
Open Worldwide Application Security Project
it is nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software.
- Broken access control
- Cryptographic failures
- Injection
- Insecure design
- Security misconfiguration
- Vulnerable and outdated components
- Identification and authentication failures
- Software and date integrity failures
- Securing logging and monitoring failures
- Server-side request forgery

### (OSINT)Open source intelligence
OSINT is the collection and analysis of information from publicly available sources to generate usable intelligence.

tools:
- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) is a service that allows anyone to analyze suspicious files, domains, URLs, and IP addresses for malicious content.
    
- [MITRE ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org/) is a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.
    
- [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/) is a web-based interface where you can find OSINT tools for almost any kind of source or platform.
    
- [Have I been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) is a tool that can be used to search for breached email accounts.

Weakness and flows are found during vulnerability assessments.

## Vulnerability Assessment
It is the internal review process of an organization's security systems.

It is like the CVE list but performed by the organization's security team (evaluated, scores, and fixes on their own)

To identify the week points and prevent attacks, and check if the security control meet the regulatory standards.

### Vulnerability Assessment process
1. Identification (manual and scanning tools, to understand the current state)
2. Vulnerability analysis (find the source of the problem)
3. Risk assessment (Score is assigned to the vulnerabilities: how severe the impact, and likelihood of this happening)
4. Remediation (cover the vulnerability by its score)


To do the identification there are vulnerability scanners
### Vulnerability scanner
Is a software that automatically compares known vulnerabilities and exposures against the technologies on the network.

These tools scan systems for misconfigurations or programming flaws.
By analyze the defense in depth strategy five layers:

1. **External vs. Internal**
External scans test the perimeter layer outside of the internal network (like websites and firewalls to detect the vulnerable network ports or servers)

Internal scans the organization's internal systems (like application software for weaknesses, and the user inputs)

2. **Authenticated vs. unauthenticated**
Test the authenticated account for the broken access controls (The user not an admin, and the admin can do his admin stuff)

Unauthenticated it must have access denied for the files that is not public.

3. Limited vs. Comprehensive
Limited scans analyze particular devices on a network, like searching for misconfigurations on a firewall.

Comprehensive scans analyze all devices connected to a network. This includes operating systems, user databases, and more.

CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) recommends:
- Using Automatic updates
- Discontinuing the use of EOL (End-of-Life) software because it poses an unfixable risks to the systems.

## Vulnerability analysis:
To analysis the the vulnerability and give it score we use the PEN TEST
