## CIA triad
A foundation model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability
**Confidentiality**: only the authorized users can access specific assets or data.
**Integrity**: data is correct, authentic, and reliable.
**Availability**: Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

Maintaining an acceptable level of risk and ensuring systems and policies are designed with these elements in mind helps establish a successful **security posture**

**Security posture** is an organizationâ€™s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.
