	- Control categories:
		- Administrative controls: related to human component
		- Technical Controls: Hardware and Software solutions to protect assets. (IDS)
		- Physical Controls: prevent physical access to protected assets, (CCTV)
- Assessing compliance
	- determining whether or not the organization is adhering to necessary compliance regulations. (GDPR, PCI DSS)

## Security tools

**Logs** are the source of data that the tools we'll cover are designed to organize.

A log is a record of events that occur within an organization's systems.
i.e. security related logs include records of employees signing into thier computers or accessing web-based services.

## Security information and event management (SIEM)
**Security information and event management** (SIEM) tool is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization, by collecting a real-time information and allow security analysts to identify potential breaches.
- Splunk (self hosted SIEM solution)
- Google Chronicla (Cloud-native SIEM sool)

## Playbook
**Playbook** is a manual that provides details about any operational action, including incident response, security or compliance reviews, access management, and many other organizational tasks that require a documented process from beginning to end.

Packet sniffer (Network protocol analyzer) is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within network.

## Programming
used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks.
programming languages, such as Python, to execute automation or Structured Query Language (SQL) to create, interact with, and request information from a database

An **operating system** is the interface between computer hardware and the user. Linux®, macOS®, and Windows are operating systems.

A **web vulnerability** is a unique flaw in a web application that a threat actor could exploit by using malicious code or behavior, to allow unauthorized access, data theft, and malware deployment.

**Antivirus software** is a software program used to prevent, detect, and eliminate malware and viruses. It is also called anti-malware. Depending on the type of antivirus software, it can scan the memory of a device to find patterns that indicate the presence of malware.

An **intrusion detection system** (IDS) is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions.

**Encryption** is the process of converting data from a readable format to a cryptographically encoded format which makes data unreadable and difficult to decode for an unauthorized user; its main goal is to ensure confidentiality of private data

**Penetration testing**, also called pen testing, is the act of participating in a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes.
