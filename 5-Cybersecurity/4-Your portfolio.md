portfolios to demonstrate their security education, skills, and knowledge
Portfolios are more in depth than a resume, which is typically a one-to-two page summary of relevant education, work experience, and accomplishments.

To do so, including self-hosted and online options such as:
- Documents folder
- Google Drive or Dropbox
- Google Sites
- Git repository

A documents folder is a folder created and saved to your computer’s hard drive.
Ensuring that your professional documents, images, and other information are well organized can save you a lot of time when you’re ready to apply for jobs.
- Resume
- Education
- Portfolio documents
- Cybersecurity tools
- Programming

Google Drive and Dropbox Similar to a documents folder, but cloud based

> **Note:** Do not include any private, copyrighted, or proprietary documents in your portfolio. Also, keep your site set to “private” until it is finalized.
