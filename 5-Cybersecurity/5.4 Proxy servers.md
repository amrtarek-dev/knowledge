proxy server is a server that fulfills the request ofÂ a client by forwarding them on to other servers.

Proxy servers utilize network address translation (NAT) to serve as a barrier between clients on the network and external threats.

It is a dedicated server that sits between the internet and the rest of the network.

It is a public IP address that is different from the rest of the private network, which hides the private network's IP address from malicious actors.

- Reverse Proxy server: regulates and restricts the internet access to an internal server. To accept traffic from external parties, approve it, and forward it to the internet servers.
