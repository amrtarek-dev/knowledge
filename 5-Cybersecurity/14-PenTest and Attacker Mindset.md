## Penetration Testing
It is simulated attack that helps to identify vulnerabilities in systems, network, websites, applications and processes.

PenTest is exploit the weaknesses to determine the potential consequences.

> Organizations that are regulated by PCI DSS, HIPAA, or GDPR must routinely perform penetration testing to maintain compliance standards.

**categories**:
- **Red team** tests _simulate attacks_ to identify vulnerabilities in systems
- **Blue team** tests focus on _defense_
- Purple team tests are _collaborative_ (Attack + Defense)

Strategies:
They are 3:
1. **Open-box testing** is when the tester has the same privileged access that an internal developer would have—information
2. **Closed-box testing** is when the tester has little to no access to internal systems
3. **Partial knowledge testing** is when the tester has limited access and knowledge of an internal system

## Attack surface
All the potential Vulnerabilities that a treat actor could exploit.

Analyzing the attack surface is usually the first thing the security teams do.

- Physical attack surface:
	- People and their devices
- Digital attack surface
	- Includes everything that's beyond our organization's firewall, everything that's connected to an organization's network.

## Security hardening
The process of strengthening a system to reduce its vulnerabilities and attack surface.

Minimizing the attack surface by limiting its points of entry.
To apply the attacker mindset you can simulate the attack. there is 2 ways to do so:
1. ProActive: RedTeam exercise
2. ReActive: Blue Team Exercise

## Practicing an attacker mindset
1. Identify a target
2. Determine how the target can be accessed
3. Evaluate attack vectors that can be exploited
4. Find the tools and methods of attack

## Threat Actor
is any person or group who presents a security risk
Normally divided into five categories based on their motivations:
- **Competitors**: benefit from leaked information.
- **State actors** are government intelligence agencies.
- **Criminal syndicates**: organized groups of people who make money from criminal activity.
- **Insider threats**: employees who accidentally compromise assets, or purposefully.
- **Shadow IT**: employee uses their personal email to send work-related communications.

## Type of Hackers
1. Unauthorized hackers 
From Script kiddies to the Professional Black Hat hacker
2. Authorized, or ethical, hackers
Improve an organization's overall security (external security vendors by Bug bounty)
3. Semi-authorized hackers
individuals who might violate ethical standards, but are not considered malicious. For example, a **hacktivist** is a person who might use their skills to achieve a political goal


An **advanced persistent threat (APT)** refers to instances when a threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time.

## The Hacker access points (Attack Vectors):
The pathways attackers use to penetrate security defenses.
Threat actors use attack vectors to exploit vulnerabilities and exposures.

- **Direct access**, when they have physical access to a system
- **Removable media**, like USB flash drives
- **Social media platforms**, used for communication and content sharing
- **Email**
- **Wireless networks** on premises
- **Cloud services** usually provided by third-party organizations
- **Supply chains** like third-party vendors that can present a backdoor into systems




## Defending attack vectors
1. Educating users
2. Applying the principle of least privilege
3. Using the right security controls and tools
4. Building a diverse security team


## Brute force Attacks
are a trial-and-error process of discovering private information.

Type:
- Simple (try any combination of username and password)
- Dictionary (use a list of commonly used credentials to access a system)
- Credential stuffing (use stolen login credentials from previous data breaches)
	- Pass the hash (reuse stolen, unsalted hashed credentials to trick an authentication system)

Tools:
- Aircrack-ng
- Hashcat 
- John the Ripper
- Ophcrack
- THC Hydra

Prevention:
- Hashing and salting
    Hashing converts information into a unique value that can then be used to determine its integrity.
    **Salting** is an additional safeguard that’s used to strengthen hash functions
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
    is a security measure that requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network
- CAPTCHA
    Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.
	    - Text CAPTCHA
	    - Image CAPTCHA
- Password policies
	- passwords that are at least 8 characters long and feature a letter, number, and symbol.
	- password lockout can limit the number of login attempts before access to an account is suspended and require users to create new, unique passwords after a certain amount of time

## Social Engineering
A manipulation technique that exploit human error to gain private information, access, or valuables

Type of attacks:
- Baiting
USB baiting that relies on someone finding an infected USB drive and plugging it into their device.
- Phishing : trick people via email (or digital communication)
- Quid pro quo: provide their account details to claim the deal
- Tailgating (piggybacking): unauthorized people follow an authorized person into a restricted area
- Watering hole: threat actor compromises a website frequently visited by a specific group of users



Stages of social engineering:
- Prepare (gather information)
- Establish trust (use the information)
- Use persuasion tactics (exploit)
- Disconnect from the target

Preventing:
- Implement managerial controls
- Staying informed of trends
- Sharing your knowledge with others
