A firewall is a network security device that monitors traffic to and from your network.

It either allows traffic or it blocks it based on a defined set of security rules by port filtering 
- Hardware firewall: the most basic way to defend against threats to a network.
- Software firewall makes the same functions as a hardware, but not a physical device, instead it is a software installed on a computer or a server.
- FaaS (Firewall as a service): cloud based firewalls that are hosted by a cloud service provider.

## Stateful or Stateless
Refers to how the firewall operates
- stateful: the firewall keeps track of information passing through it and proactively filters out threats.
- Stateless: the firewall operate based on predefined rules and does not keep tracking of the information from the data packets.

## Next generation Firewall (NGFW)
it provide more security than stateful firewall, it provide stateful inspection of incoming and outgoing traffic, and more in-depth security like deep packet inspection and intrusion protection.
it can also connect to cloud-based threat intelligence services to update and protect against emerging cyber threats.
