Network is a group of connected devices

The devices on a network can communicate with each other over network cables, or wireless connections.

These devices will use unique addresses, or identifiers, to locate each other

two types of networks: 
a local area network, also known as a LAN, and a wide area network, also known as a WAN.

A hub is a network device that broadcasts information to every device on the network.

A switch makes connections between specific devices on a network by sending and receiving data between them. 
A switch is more intelligent than a hub. 
It only passes data to the intended destination.

A router is a network device that connects multiple networks together.

A modem is a device that connects your router to the internet, and brings internet access to the LAN. with an internet service provider (ISP). ISPs provide internet connectivity via telephone lines or coaxial cables.

A **wireless access point** sends and receives digital signals over radio waves creating a wireless network.

Virtualization tools are pieces of software that perform network operations.

Virtualization tools carry out operations that would normally be completed by a hub, switch, router, or modem, and they are offered by Cloud service providers.

A **firewall** is a network security device that monitors traffic to or from your network.

**Servers** provide information and services for devices like computers, smart home devices, and smartphones on the network.

**Network diagrams** are maps that show the devices on the network and how they connect.

## Cloud networks

Cloud computing is the practice of using remote servers, applications, and network services that are hosted on the internet instead of on local physical devices.

A cloud network is a collection of servers or computers that stores resources and data in a remote data center that can be accessed via the internet. 

Because companies don't house the servers at their physical location, these servers are referred to as being "in the cloud".

A cloud service provider (CSP) offer an alternative to traditional on-premise networks, and allow organizations to have the benefits of the traditional network without storing the devices and managing the network on their own.

CSPs provide three main categories of services:

- **Infrastructure as a service** **(IaaS)** refers to the use of virtual computer components offered by the CSP. These include virtual containers and storage that are configured remotely through the CSP’s API or web console.
	- Physical data center
	- Servers networking storage
- **Platform as a service (PaaS)** refers to tools that application developers can use to design custom applications for their company.
	- IaaS + operating systems
	- Database management & development tools
- **Software as a service (SaaS)** refers to software suites operated by the CSP that a company can use remotely without hosting the software.
	- PaaS + Cloud-hosting applications.

The organizations using:
- On-premises
- cloud environment
- hybrid cloud environment
- multi-cloud environment
