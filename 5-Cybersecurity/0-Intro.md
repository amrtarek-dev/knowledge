**Cybersecurity** is the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people and data from unauthorized access of criminal exploitation.

**Compliance** is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.

A **threat actor**, or malicious attacker, is any person or group who presents a security risk. This risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data.

**Network security** is the practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. This includes data, services, systems, and devices that are stored in an organization’s network.

**Cloud security** is the process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured, or set up correctly, and access to those assets is limited to authorized users. The cloud is a network made up of a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote physical locations known as data centers that can be accessed via the internet. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.

**Programming** is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. These tasks can include:
- Automation of repetitive tasks (e.g., searching a list of malicious domains)
- Reviewing web traffic 
- Alerting suspicious activity

Cybersecurity importance: to prevent incidents that may expose people's personally identifiable information.
**Personal identifiable information** (PII), is any information used to infer an individual's identity includes full name, date of birth, physical address, phone number, email address, internet protocol, or IP address and similar information.
**Sensitive personal identifiable Information (SPII)**, a specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines includes social security number, medical or financial information, and biometric data, like facial recognition.

A **computer virus** is malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software.
The virus attaches itself to programs or documents on a computer, then spreads and infects one or more computers in a network.
Nowadays it called Malware, which is a software designed to harm devices or networks.
Most Famous 2 are:
- Brain virus
- Morris worm

After Morris worm, a **Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs)** were established to respond to computer security incidents. 

Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access or valuables.
