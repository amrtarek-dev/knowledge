## Security Frameworks
Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy, it provides a structural approach to implementing a security life cycle.
Frameworks have four core components:
- identifying and documenting security goals.
- settingÂ guidelines to achieve security goals.
- implementing strong security processes.
- monitoring and communicating results

## Security Controls
Are the safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.
## CIA triad
A foundation model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Accessibility
Confidentiality: only the authorized users can access specific assets or data.
Integrity: data is correct, authentic, and reliable.
Availability: Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
National Institute of Standards and Technology
A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

And NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)

## Security Ethics
Are guideline for making appropriate decisions as a security professional.

### CounterAttacks
Counterattack on a threat actor is illegal because of laws.
The international Court of Justice (ICJ) states that a person or group can counterattack if:
- Will only affect the party that attacked first
- Is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop
- Does not escalate the situation.
- The counterattack effects can be reversed.

## Ethical principles and methodologies
**Confidentiality** means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data.
**Privacy protection** means safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use.
**Laws** are rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity.

**Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**
