## Security Frameworks
Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy, it provides a structural approach to implementing a security life cycle.
Frameworks have four core components:
- identifying and documenting security goals.
- settingÂ guidelines to achieve security goals.
- implementing strong security processes.
- monitoring and communicating results
Organizations often uses framework to create there own security policies and processes.

Cyber Threat Framework (CTF) is a common language for describing and communicating information about cyber threat activity.

ISO/IEC 27001 (International Organization for Standardization) / International Electrotechnical Commission
the ISO 27000 family standards enables organizations of all sectors and sizes to manage the security of assets.

It outlines requirements for an information security management system, best practices and controls that support an organization's ability to manage risks.
## Security Controls
Are the safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. they are the measures organizations use to lower risk and threats to data and privacy.
By three type of controls:
- Encryption
- Authentication
- Authorization

Encryption is the process of converting data from a readable format (plan-text) to an encoded format (Cipher-text).

Authentication is the process of verifying who someone or something is.

Authorization is the concept of granting access to specific resources within a system (the person has permission to access)


## CIA triad
A foundation model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability
Confidentiality: only the authorized users can access specific assets or data.
Integrity: data is correct, authentic, and reliable.
Availability: Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.


## Security Ethics
Are guideline for making appropriate decisions as a security professional.

### CounterAttacks
Counterattack on a threat actor is illegal because of laws.
The international Court of Justice (ICJ) states that a person or group can counterattack if:
- Will only affect the party that attacked first
- Is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop
- Does not escalate the situation.
- The counterattack effects can be reversed.

## Ethical principles and methodologies
**Confidentiality** means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data.
**Privacy protection** means safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use.
**Laws** are rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity.

**Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA):** A U.S. federal law established to protect patients' health information

**Integrity:** The idea that the data is correct, authentic, and reliable

**National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Security Framework (CSF):** A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk

**Privacy protection:** The act of safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use

**Protected health information (PHI):** Information that relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual

**Security architecture:** A type of security design composed of multiple components, such as tools and processes, that are used to protect an organization from risks and external threats

**Security controls:** Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks

**Security ethics:** Guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional

**Security frameworks:** Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy

**Security governance:** Practices that help support, define, and direct security efforts of an organization

**Sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII):** A specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines
