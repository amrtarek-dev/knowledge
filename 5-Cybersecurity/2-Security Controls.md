## Security Frameworks
Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy, it provides a structural approach to implementing a security life cycle.
Frameworks have four core components:
- identifying and documenting security goals.
- settingÂ guidelines to achieve security goals.
- implementing strong security processes.
- monitoring and communicating results

## Security Controls
Are the safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.
## CIA triad
A foundation model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Accessibility
Confidentiality: only the authorized users can access specific assets or data.
Integrity: data is correct, authentic, and reliable.
Availability: Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
National Institute of Standards and Technology
A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

And NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)

## Security Ethics
Are guideline for making appropriate decisions as a security professional.

### CounterAttacks
Counterattack on a threat actor is illegal because of laws.
The international Court of Justice (ICJ) states that a person or group can counterattack if:
- Will only affect the party that attacked first
- Is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop
- Does not escalate the situation.
- The counterattack effects can be reversed.

## Ethical principles and methodologies
**Confidentiality** means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data.
**Privacy protection** means safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use.
**Laws** are rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity.

**Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA):** A U.S. federal law established to protect patients' health information

**Integrity:** The idea that the data is correct, authentic, and reliable

**National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Security Framework (CSF):** A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk

**Privacy protection:** The act of safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use

**Protected health information (PHI):** Information that relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual

**Security architecture:** A type of security design composed of multiple components, such as tools and processes, that are used to protect an organization from risks and external threats

**Security controls:** Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks

**Security ethics:** Guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional

**Security frameworks:** Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy

**Security governance:** Practices that help support, define, and direct security efforts of an organization

**Sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII):** A specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines
