## Vulnerability
A weakness that can be exploited by a threat.
i.e Outdated firewall, software or application, weak password, or unprotected confidential data.
- **ProxyLogon:** A pre-authenticated vulnerability that affects the Microsoft Exchange server. This means a threat actor can complete a user authentication process to deploy malicious code from a remote location.
- **ZeroLogon:** A vulnerability in Microsoft’s Netlogon authentication protocol. An authentication protocol is a way to verify a person's identity. Netlogon is a service that ensures a user’s identity before allowing access to a website's location.
- **Log4Shell:** Allows attackers to run Java code on someone else’s computer or leak sensitive information. It does this by enabling a remote attacker to take control of devices connected to the internet and run malicious code.
- **PetitPotam:** Affects Windows New Technology Local Area Network (LAN) Manager (NTLM). It is a theft technique that allows a LAN-based attacker to initiate an authentication request.
- **Security logging and monitoring failures:** Insufficient logging and monitoring capabilities that result in attackers exploiting vulnerabilities without the organization knowing it
- **Server-side request forgery:** Allows attackers to manipulate a server-side application into accessing and updating backend resources. It can also allow threat actors to steal data.

## Threat
Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.
- like social engineering attack
**Internal threat:** A current or former employee, external vendor, or trusted partner who poses a security risk
**External threat:** Anything outside the organization that has the potential to harm organizational assets

## Risk
Anything that can impact the confidentiality integrity, or availability of an asset.
- **High-risk asset**: Information protected by regulations or laws, which if compromised would have a severe negative impact on an organization's finances, ongoing operations, or reputation.
- **Medium-risk asset**: Information that's not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organization's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations.
- **Low-risk asset**: information that would not harm the organization' s reputation or ongoing operations, and would not cause financial damage if compromised.

- **External risk:** Anything outside the organization that has the potential to harm organizational assets, such as threat actors attempting to gain access to private information
- **Internal risk:** A current or former employee, vendor, or trusted partner who poses a security risk
- **Legacy systems:** Old systems that might not be accounted for or updated, but can still impact assets, such as workstations or old mainframe systems. For example, an organization might have an old vending machine that takes credit card payments or a workstation that is still connected to the legacy accounting system.
- **Multiparty risk:** Outsourcing work to third-party vendors can give them access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets, software designs, and inventions.
- **Software compliance/licensing:** Software that is not updated or in compliance, or patches that are not installed in a timely manner

## Threat Actor:
is any person or group who presents a security risk.

A **hacker** is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data.
- Authorized hackers are also called ethical hackers.
- Semi-authorized hackers are considered researchers.
- Unauthorized hackers are also called unethical hackers.
- vigilantes : Their main goal is to protect the world from unethical hackers.
**Hacktivists** are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda.

**Insider threats** abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization.

**Advanced persistent threats** (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization.

## Impacts of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities
- Financial impact
- Identity theft
- Organization's reputation.

## Layers of the web
- Surface web
- Deep web
- Dark web

Surface web is the layer that most people use, it contains the content that we access using a web browser.

Deep web generally requires authorization to access it. (An organization's intranet is an example.)

Dark web can only be accessed by using a special software.


## Risk management
A primary goal of organizations is to protect assets.
Some common strategies used to manage risks include:
- **Acceptance**: Accepting a risk to avoid disrupting business continuity
- **Avoidance**: Creating a plan to avoid the risk altogether
- **Transference**: Transferring risk to a third party to manage
- **Mitigation**: Lessening the impact of a known risk
