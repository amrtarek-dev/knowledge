Malware is a malicious software that damages or disables computer systems and gives limited or full control of the systems to the malware creator for purpose of theft or fraud.
- Attack browsers and track websites visited
- Slow down systems and degrade system performace.
- Cause hardware failure, rendering computers inoperable.
- Steal Personal information, including contacts.

Can enter a system by:
- Instant Messenger applications
- Portable hardware media/ removable devices
- Browser and email software bugs
- Untrusted sites and freeware web applications/software.
- Downloading files from the internet
- Email attachments
- Installation by other malware
- Bluetooth and wireless networks.

Common Web Malware Distribution:
- Black hat search engine Optimiztation: Ranking malware pages highly in search results
- Social Engineered Click-jacking: clicking on innocent-looking webpages.
- Spear-phishing Sites: mimicking legitimate institutions in an attempt to steal login credentials
- Malvertising: Embedding malware in ad-networks that displays across hundreds of legitimate, high-traffic sites.
- Compromised Legitimate websites: Hosting embedded malware that spreads to unsuspecting visitors
- Drive-by Downloads: Exploiting flaws in browser software to install malware just by visiting a web site
- Spam Emails: Attaching the malware to emails and tricking victims to click the attachment.

## Components of Malware
The components of a malware software depend on the requirements of the malware author who design it for a specific target :
- Cypter: Softer that protects malware form undergoing reverse engineering or analysis.
- Downloader: A type of Trojan that downloads other malware from the internet on the PC
- Dropper: A type pf Trojan that covertly installs other malware files on to the system.
- Exploit: A malicious code that breaches the system security via software vulnerabilities to access information or install malware.
- Injector: A program that injects its code into other vulnerable running processes and changes how they execute to hide or prevent its removal.
- Obfuscator: A program that conceals its code and intended purpose via various techniques and thus, makes it hard for security machanisms to detect or remove it.
- Packer: a program that allows all files to bundle together into a single executable file via compression to bypass security software detection.
- Payload: a piece of software that allows control over a computer system after it has been exploited.
- Malicious Code: a command that defines malware's basic functionalities such as stealing data na creating backdoors.

## Trojan
It is a program in which a malicious or harmful code is contained inside an apparently harmless program or data, which can later gain control and cause damage.

It gets activated when a user performs certain predefined actions.

It create a covert communication channel between the victim computer and the attacker for transferring sensitive data.

Trojans types:
- Remote Access Trojans
- Backdoor Trojans
- Botnet Trojans
- Rootkit Trojans
- E-Banking Trojans
- Point-of-sale Trojans
- Defacement Trojans
- Service Protocol Trojans
- Mobile Trojans
- IoT Trojans
- Security Software Disabler Trojans
- Destructive Trojans
- DDoS Attack Trojans
- Command Shell Trojans.

Creating a Trojan:
Trojan horse construction kits help attackers to construct Trojan horses of their choice.
- DarkHorse Trojan Virus maker
- Trojan horse Construction kit
- Senna Spy Trojan Generator
- Batch Trojan Generator
- Umbra Loader - Botnet Trojan Maker
- Theef RAT Trojan (Remote Access Trojan): port 9871
- Sub7
- Net Bus
- Beast

**Botnets**: is a collection of compromised computers connected to the internet to perform a distributed task.
Attackers distribute malicious software that turns a user's computer into bot.
Bot refers to a program or an infected system that performs repetitive work as an agent or a user interface to control other programs.

## Virus
It is a self-replicating program that produces its own copy by attaching itself to another program, computer boot sector or document.

Viruses are generally transmitted through file downloads, infected disk/flash drivers, and as email attachments.
- Infect other programs
- Transfer themselves
- Encrypt themselves
- Alter data
- Corrupt files and programs
- Self-replicate.

Types:
- System or Boot sector Virus
- File and multipartite Virus
- Macro and Cluster Virus
- Stealth/Tunneling Virus
- Encryption Virus
- Sparse Infector Virus
- Polymorphic Virus
- Metamorphic Virus
- Overwriting File or Cavity Virus
- Companion/Camouflage Virus
- Shell and File Extension Virus
- FAT and logic Bomb Virus
- Web Scripting Virus
- Email and Armored Virus
- Add-on and intrusive Virus
- Direct Action or Transient Virus
- Terminate & Stay Resident Virus

Creating Virus:
Virus constriction kits (Virus maker tools):
- DELmE's Batch Virus Maker
- Bhavesh Virus Maker SKW
- Deadly Virus Maker
- SonicBat Batch Virus Maker
- TeraBIT Virus Maker
- Andreinick05's Batch Virus Maket
- JPS Virus Maker


## Ransomware
A type of malware that restricts access to the computer system's files and folders, demands an online ransom payment to the malware creator(s) to remove the restrictions.


## Computer Worms
Malicious programs that independently replicate, execute, and spread across the network connections.
(It do not have to infect the executables files like viruses)

Consume available computing resources without human interaction.

Attackers use worm payloads to install backdoors in infected computers.

## Rootkits
they are programs that hide their presence as well as attacker's malicious activities, granting them full access to the server or host at that time and in the future.

It replace certain operating system calls and utilities with their own modified versions of those routines that, in turn undermine the security of the target system causing malicious functions to be executed.
(Patching the OS kernels)

A typical rootkit comprises of backdoor programs, DDoS programs packet sniffers, log-wiping utilities, IRC bots, etc.


## PUAs
Potentially Unwanted Application or Applications.
Also known as grayware or junkware, are potentially harmful applications that may cause severe risks to the security and privacy of data stored in the system where they are installed.

Installed when downloading and installing freeware using a third-party installer or when accepting a misleading license agreement.

Covertly monitor and later the data or setting in the system, similarly to other malware
- Adware
- Torrent
- Marketing
- Cryptomining
- Dialers.

Adware: 
it is a software or a program that supports advertisements and generation unsolicited ads and pop-ups.
Tracks the cookies and user browsing patterns for marketing purposes and collects user data.
- it cause frequent system lag
- Inundated advertiesmnets
- Increase system crash
- Disparity in the default browser homepage
- Presence of new toolbar or browser add-ons
- Slow Internet.

## Spyware
it is spys on your activity, a stealth program that records the user's interaction with the computer and the Internet without the user's knowledge and sends the information to the remote attackers.
It hides its process, files, and other objects in order to avoid detection and removal.
- Desktop spyware
- Chat spyware
- Keystroke Loggers
- Program executed spyware

Keylogger
Keystroke loggers are programs or hardware devices that monitor each keystroke as the user types on a keyboard, logs onto a file, or transmits them to a remote location.
It allows the attacker to gather confidential information about the victim such as email ID, passwords, banking details, chat room activity, IRC, and instant messages.
- Drive (Hardware)
- Software

## Fileless Malware
also known as non-malware, There is no footprint for the malware in the file system to be detected, it infects legitimate software, application and other protocol existing in the system to perform various malicious activities and resides in the system's RAM.
Laverages any existing vulnerabilities to infect the system, by injects malicious code into the running processes such as Microsoft Word, Flash, Adobe PDF Reader, Javascript, and PowerShell.
Techniques:
- Phishing emails
- Legitimate applications
- Native applications
- Infection through lateral movement
- Malicious website
- Registry manipulation
- Memory code injection
- Script-based injection.
