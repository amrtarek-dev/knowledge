(Teletype Network) is a text-based network protocol used to connect to a computer remotely. Developed in 1969 and widely used in the early days of the Internet, it is specifically designed for interacting with network devices, servers or other endpoints.

It provides a login interface with a username and password so that users can execute commands as if they were on the local terminal of that computer.

``` bash
telnet <SERVER-IP-ADDRESS> <PORT-NUMBER>
```
