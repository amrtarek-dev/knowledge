# Make Strategy
You have to have 4 steps to make strategy (CEST):
- Conditions (Which enable the strategy)
- Entry (where you are going to enter the market)
- Stop loos ( where you are going to exit the market to avoid loos) 
- Target (Where you are going to exit the market to gain the profit)

> The strategy needs to be back tested before real money.

## Support and resistance
Buy (long) when UpTrend (Bullish) 
- Resistance point reached for the second time.
- Gain profit = the last resistance area.
- stop loss = the previous support area


Sell (Short) when DownTrend (Bearish) 
- Supported point reached for the second time.
- stop loss = the previous supported area
- Gain profit = the last support area.

if the candle is 38.2 % (reverse Hamer shape)
it will be a resistance area (go short)

## Double Bottom or Up
