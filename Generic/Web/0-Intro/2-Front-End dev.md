To create a website, developers typically use three main technologies that work together:
- **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**   
- **JavaScript**    
These languages complement one another to build both the **structure** and the **functionality** of a website.
## HTML – Structure
**HTML** is the foundation of every website. It defines the physical structure and elements of a page, including:
- Text content    
- Hyperlinks    
- Images and videos    
- Page sections and dividers    
- Buttons and forms    
Think of HTML as the **skeleton** of a website.

## CSS – Styling
**CSS** is used to style and design the HTML structure, giving a website its **look and feel**. It controls:
- Colors and fonts    
- Layouts and spacing    
- Page designs and responsiveness    
It also ensures **cross-browser compatibility**, making the same site usable on desktops, mobile devices, and tablets.

## JavaScript – Interactivity
**JavaScript** is an object-oriented programming language that works alongside HTML and CSS. It adds:
- Interactivity (click events, animations, dropdowns)    
- Dynamic content (live updates, form validation)    
- Responsive behavior (adjusting to devices or user input)    
JavaScript turns static websites into **dynamic, interactive applications**.

## CSS Preprocessors
Modern development often extends CSS with more powerful tools:
- **SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)**    
    - An extension of CSS, fully compatible with all versions.        
    - Adds features like **variables, nested rules, and inline imports**, making it easier to keep styles organized and reusable.        
    - Helps developers create style sheets **faster and more efficiently**.

- **LESS (Leaner Style Sheets)**    
    - Enhances CSS with additional functions and features.        
    - Uses **Less.js**, a JavaScript tool, to convert LESS code into standard CSS.

## Responsive Design
**Responsive Web Design** ensures that websites adapt automatically to different screen sizes and devices.  
This means one website can adjust for **desktop, mobile, tablets, and beyond** without needing separate versions.

## JavaScript Frameworks

Frameworks are pre-built sets of JavaScript code that help developers build applications more efficiently. They simplify tasks like routing, state management, and responsiveness.

Popular frameworks include:
- **Angular** (by Google) → A full-featured framework with built-in routing.
- **React.js** (by Facebook) → A library focused on building UI components (routing requires extra tools).
- **Vue.js** (community-driven) → Flexible, can act as both a lightweight library or a full framework.
