When you interact with a website, you typically use a browser such as **Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, or Apple Safari**.
You enter a URL, and the browser sends a request to the server. The server then responds with the data the client (browser) needs to display the page.
Most websites return three main components:
- **HTML** → Defines the structure of the page.
- **CSS** → Adds style, design, and visual flair.
- **JavaScript** → Provides interactivity and dynamic behavior.

## Static vs. Dynamic Content
- **Static Content**  
    Content that is pre-stored on the server and delivered exactly as it is to the client. Example: a simple HTML page.
- **Dynamic Content**  
    Content generated on-demand, often by fetching data from a **database** or other services before sending it to the client.

## Cloud Applications
Modern applications are often built to run with a **cloud-based backend infrastructure**. This includes:
- Cloud data storage
- Cloud-based data processing
- Additional cloud services

Cloud-powered applications are:
- **Scalable** (can grow with user demand)
- **Resilient** (can handle failures more effectively)

## Front-End & Back-End
Website development is divided into two main areas:
- **Front-End (Client-Side)**  
    What the user sees and interacts with directly in the browser.
- **Back-End (Server-Side)**  
    Handles server operations, databases, authentication, and application logic.
A **Full-Stack Developer** has the skills and experience to work on both front-end and back-end.

## Developer Tools
Developers use tools to write, debug, and maintain code.
- **Code Editors**  
    Lightweight tools focused on writing and editing code.
- **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**  
    Provide a full suite for integration, building, debugging, and testing code.

Examples include:
- Sublime Text
- Atom
- Vim
- VS Code
- Visual Studio
- Eclipse
- NetBeans
