## **What is Node.js?**
- **Node.js** is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side, outside of the browser.
- It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- It is ideal for building scalable, high-performance, and lightweight applications like APIs, real-time services, and more.

### **What is npm?**
- **npm (Node Package Manager)** is a tool that comes with Node.js and helps you manage packages (libraries or tools) for your project.
- With npm, you can install, share, and manage dependencies for your project.

### **How to Install Node.js and npm**
1. Go to the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version (recommended for most users).
3. Install Node.js, and npm will be installed along with it.

To check if theyâ€™re installed:
``` bash
node -v
npm -v
```


## Event Loop
Node.js is single-threaded and uses non-blocking I/O, making it highly efficient for I/O operations.
