Network management in Linux is accomplished through commands and configuration files.

### Network Interface Card (NIC)
It is the network card you have in your machine, and you can configure it in Debian based distributions by `ifconfig` command.

``` bash
user@machine:~$ ifconfig

eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 172.20.1.109  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 172.20.1.255
        inet6 fe80::5054:ff:fe10:72c3  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 52:54:00:10:72:c3  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 4542  bytes 352144 (343.8 KiB)
        RX errors 2  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 2
        TX packets 1475  bytes 6213607 (5.9 MiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
        device interrupt 11  memory 0xfc840000-fc860000  

lo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536
        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        inet6 ::1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x10<host>
        loop  txqueuelen 1000  (Local Loopback)
        RX packets 16  bytes 1888 (1.8 KiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 16  bytes 1888 (1.8 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

In this output there are 2 network interfaces:
`eth0`: This is the Ethernet card interface. The `UP` flag indicates it is active.
The IP address is `172.20.1.109`.
The MAC address is `52:54:00:10:72:c3`.

`lo`: This is the Loopback interface. It is a virtual interface created to allow local networking, pointing to the 127.0.0.1 IP address.

This command showing only the UP interfaces, so to show all interfaces you can use:
``` bash
ifconfig -a
```

#### Activating and Deactivating Interfaces
To bring an interface (e.g., `eth0` ) up, use the `ifconfig` command as follows:
``` bash 
ifconfig eth0 up
```
And to take interface down:
``` bash
ifconfig eth0 down
```

### Configure the NIC
To assign IP address
``` bash
ifconfig eth0 172.20.1.110
```

To assign a net-mask
``` bash
ifconfig eth0 netmask 255.255.255.0
```

To change the mac address
``` bash
ifconfig eth0 hw ether AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```

To put the NIC in the `Promiscuous mode`
If the NIC supports it, it will enable promiscuous mode to process packets intended for other devices on the same network
To Enable it
``` bash
ifconfig eth0 promisc
```

To disable it
``` bash
ifconfig eth0 -promisc
```
