In Linux, the term "process" is defined as a program loaded into memory and executing in the processor (CPU).

## Terminal process

By default, all processes run in the **foreground**. They take input from the keyboard and display output on the screen.

**Background** processes do not lock the terminal when run; they start running in the background. When background processes are running, multiple processes can run in parallel.

``` shell
user@machine:~$ pwd &
[1]   +   Done                 pwd
```

`[1]`  indicates that the process job number is 1.
`Done` indicates that the process successfully completed its task.

to list the bg processes:
``` shell
user@machine:~$ jobs
[1]    running    ping 127.0.0.1
```

To make bg process, foreground
``` shell
fg %1
```


## Managing System-Wide Processes
In addition to processes in our current terminal session, there are processes running system-wide. These can be processes used by the operating system, the terminal, service providers, or programs that continuously run in the background.


```shell
user@machine:~$ ps

PID       TTY      TIME        CMD
19        pts/1    00:00:00    sh
24        pts/1    00:00:00    ps
```

For a more detailed output, we can use the `-f` parameter of the `ps` command.

``` shell
user@machine:~$ ps -f

UID      PID  PPID C STIME    TTY        TIME CMD
1001     19     1 0 07:20    pts/1  00:00:00f     sh
1001     25    19 0 08:04    pts/1  00:00:00      ps -f
```

|Column Name|Description|
|---|---|
|UID|User ID - The ID number of the user running the process|
|PID|Process ID - The unique identifier for the process|
|PPID|Parent Process ID - The unique identifier for the parent process that started the process|
|C|CPU - The CPU usage of the process|
|STIME|Start Time - The start time of the process|
|TTY|Terminal Type - The type of terminal where the process is running|
|TIME|The total time the process has been running|
|CMD|Command - The command that started the process|
To stop process use `kill` command
``` bash
kill 19
```

If the process does not terminate with the command above, we can forcefully stop it with the interrupt signal `-9`.

``` bash
kill -9 19
```

Signals:
- SIGTERM - Kill the process, but allow it to do some cleanup tasks beforehand
- SIGKILL - Kill the process - doesn't do any cleanup after the fact
- SIGSTOP - Stop/suspend a process


```shell
user@machine:~$ systemctl [option] [service]
```
options with `systemctl`:

- Start: start a service.
- Stop: stop running service.
- Enable: make the service run at boot time.
- Disable: stop the service from running at the boot time.

## Cron
The cron process is how we can automate the process start and stop
**Crontab** is one of the processes that is started during boot, which is responsible for facilitating and managing cron jobs.

Crontabs can be edited by using:
``` bash
crontab -e
```

| Value | Description                               |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| MIN   | What minute to execute at                 |
| HOUR  | What hour to execute at                   |
| DOM   | What day of the month to execute at       |
| MON   | What month of the year to execute at      |
| DOW   | What day of the week to execute at        |
| CMD   | The actual command that will be executed. |
0 */12 * * * cp -R /home/cmnatic/Documents /var/backups/

this will backup "cmnatic"'s  "Documents" every 12 hours
or at reboot by `@reboot`
