Microsoft Windows is an operating system developed for personal computers and widely used worldwide.
### Early Years

The journey of Microsoft Windows began in 1985 with its first version, 1.0. Unfortunately, this initial attempt was not very successful. Although users found the interface original, they generally thought it was not functional.

Sales figures were also low. Windows 1.0 was perceived more as a graphical extension of MS-DOS rather than a full-fledged operating system.

Additionally, the problems of MS-DOS were also carried over to this new interface. Running multiple programs simultaneously was very limited and did not meet the needs of office users.

However, Microsoft did not give up. They returned in 1987 with Windows 2.0. Things changed in this version. New programs developed specifically for Windows, like Excel and Word for Windows, caught the attention of office users.

Thus, the groundwork was laid for the rise of Windows.

Microsoft Windows achieved real success with its 3.0 version, released in 1990.

### XP and Beyond

In 2001, Microsoft released Windows XP, merging the NT and MS-DOS-based product lines.

Windows XP introduced a more modern and professional appearance. The Fast User Switching feature allowed multiple users to use the same computer and switch between them easily.

Windows XP remained the latest release in the Windows family for the longest period, from the beginning of 2001 until development on Vista began in 2007.

About five years after developing Windows XP, Microsoft released Windows Vista in 2006.

Despite containing many innovations and improvements, Windows Vista did not achieve the expected success due to some criticisms and its high price.

Nevertheless, the innovations brought by Windows Vista laid the foundation for subsequent operating systems like Windows 7 and Windows 10.

Windows 7's support end date was determined shortly after its release compared to XP. Windows 8.x came and went, and like Vista, had a short lifespan.

Following this, Windows 10, which remains popular on desktop computers, was released.

Windows 11 is now the most current version of the Windows operating system, and many companies are gradually transitioning machines from Windows 10 to Windows 11.

Since there are no significant interface differences and Windows 10 is very popular, this training will examine a Windows 10 machine.

Although server editions have not been discussed, the current version of the Windows operating system for servers is Windows Server 2025.

## Accessing Windows

When the computer is powered on, you will be directed to the Windows desktop or login screen. The login screen is where you enter your current account information.

### Local Access

If you are logging into a computer to which you have physical access, you are likely accessing it locally.

### Remote Access

If it's a machine you do not have physical access to (server, virtual machines, etc.), you can connect using RDP.

RDP stands for "Remote Desktop Protocol," a technology developed by Microsoft.

Remote Desktop allows you to access another computer over a network. You can work as if you were sitting directly in front of that computer.

If RDP is enabled, you can connect by entering your username and password.

A popular program that uses the RDP protocol is Remmina.

## Interface

The Windows interface is a visual environment that allows users to interact with the computer. It helps users run programs, manage files, and change settings.

Main Components:

1. Desktop: The main screen of the Windows interface. It is an area where icons, files, and folders are located.
2. Start Menu: A menu that provides access to programs, settings, and other system tools. In Windows 11, the Start Menu consists of a panel with icons and an application list.
3. Search Box: A tool located on the desktop that allows you to search for files, programs, and settings on your computer.
4. Taskbar: A bar located at the bottom of the desktop that shows running programs, open windows, and notifications.
