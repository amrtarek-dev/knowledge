Is the Study the historic price to movements in order to make accurate decisions of what the market may do next.
We use it to make those accurate decisions of what price may do next.
It is all oriented around the price.

## Candlestick Chart
It is the foundation of technical analysis, so let's understand what a single candle stick represent:
```markdown
 |.   High (the highest price during the period)
_|_.  Open
| |
| |
| |
---   Close
 |
 |.   Low
```
The candle stick is representing a certain period of time (Open and close period), maybe 1 min, 1 hour, 1 day, etc.
Depending on timeframe you have as a chart this candle will represent this period of time in price.
It consist of 2 parts:
- Body ( if the colour is green means open price is lower than the close price (Up))
- Wick


## Trending Market
they are 3 types:
- Uptrend
- Downtrend
- Consolidation
The objective way to identify the market trend is by detecting the **Impulsive moves**.
The impulsive move which a peak from low to high.
After Impulsive move the market will take a breath (Because they start to sell) **Pullbacks**
it will start to have from High to low:
- In case it become lower than the first high it will be downtrend (Lower Low)
- In case it start yo impulsive moves again before retching the lower point it will be uptrend (Lower High)

> Always decide the trending market from the time frame higher than the trade time frame
### UpTrend (Bullish)
To consider the chart uptrend when we have:
- Higher High
- Higher Low
- Higher High
In sequence
**Up trend** if The low of PullBack can not be broken by the next low pullback, (if occurred it called a possible reversal ) and the higher high of the impulsive move has broken by the next high impulsive move. (after consolidation).
### DownTrend (Bearish)
To consider the chart downtrend when we have:
- Lower low
- Lower High
- Lower Low
in sequence
**Down Trend** if the low of the impulsive move is broken by the next low impulsive move, and the pullback High does not brake the previous pullback high.

### Consolidation
This where the price change rapidly between up and down without peak.

## Support and Resistance Structure
Support structure is an area in the market is likely the price will get up from. (or be supported by)
Resistance structure is an area in the market the price will get down from.

These areas are based on historic prices or other areas of support and resistance.
 
To Identify the Support and resistance structure:
- support structure when the price hit a low point and then up and then hit the same point again most probably it will get high again (Support structure area)
- resistance structure when the price hit a high point and then down and then hit the same high point again most probably it will get low again (Resistance structure area)


> Support is the moment of buying, and Resistance is the moment of selling.

> In Uptrend the previous resistance will likely become support.
## Indicators
To simplify what price is doing, use it to:
- Identify trend
- Identify areas of value
- Identify entry points.
- Where to place stops and targets

### Average True Range (ATR)
It is the average movement of price out of the last 14 candles.
It add up the price movement in total (total amount of pips) then divides that number  by 14

> use 1% ATR for Stop loss and 1.4% for Profit margin

### Movement Average (MA)
It is the Average movement of the price over a certain period of time.
It is the closing price of N (ex: 20) of candles divided by N (20)

When the candle is up from the chart it means we are in a highly volatile up trend.

> You can use it to identify areas of value ( where when the candle touch the graph: it will be support structure or resistance). for 20, 50, and 200 length

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)
It is a momentum indicator it tells when the price has been moving in a certain direction for a long period of time
