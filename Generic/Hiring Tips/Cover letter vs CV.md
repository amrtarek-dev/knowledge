The resume tells me the facts, what have you done, but a cover letter tells me who you are.


Cover letter:
why cybersecurity
why this space
why this opportunity
what draws you here?

- A few lines about yourself, your family your hobbies.
- Cut to what makes you unique, what makes you different than this other applicant.
	- what has brought you to this opportunity?
	- how have you overcome adversity? How do you plan to do so in this work environment?
	- What does this job mean to you?
	- What are the soft skills that you can present and bring to your colleagues in this role?
- Know the company's mission, know their purpose, their products. Insert that into your cover letter.

Keep the word simple but be bold and be loud.
