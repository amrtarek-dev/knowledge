I want to know as an interviewer, does the candidate understand the fundamentals and can they explain them back to me.

Their functions, their purpose
If they didn't exist, how would you solve a problem. Outside of that, just understanding the fundamentals of topics that exists within this space, network security, web application, security knowledge, operating system internals, understanding and mastering security protocols.


Practice answering open-ended questions. 
They tend to be really difficult. They're ambiguous by design. They're complex by design.

You always want to start first by asking clarifying questions. 
Get information from your interviewer to help you narrow down the focus of the question itself, but also lower the scope of the problem into something that you can answer yourself, that you know, that you feel comfortable with.

Organize your answer to the STAR Method:
- Situation
- Task
- Action
- Results


If you don't know something, don't be afraid to say I don't know, and say but here's how I would approach the problem.
