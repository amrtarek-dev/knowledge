In Linux, the term "process" is defined as a program loaded into memory and executing in the processor (CPU).

## Terminal process

By default, all processes run in the **foreground**. They take input from the keyboard and display output on the screen.

**Background** processes do not lock the terminal when run; they start running in the background. When background processes are running, multiple processes can run in parallel.

``` shell
user@machine:~$ pwd &
[1]   +   Done                 pwd
```

`[1]`  indicates that the process job number is 1.
`Done` indicates that the process successfully completed its task.

to list the bg processes:
``` shell
user@machine:~$ jobs
[1]    running    ping 127.0.0.1
```

To make bg process, foreground
``` shell
fg %1
```


## Managing System-Wide Processes
In addition to processes in our current terminal session, there are processes running system-wide. These can be processes used by the operating system, the terminal, service providers, or programs that continuously run in the background.


```shell
user@machine:~$ ps

PID       TTY      TIME        CMD
19        pts/1    00:00:00    sh
24        pts/1    00:00:00    ps
```

For a more detailed output, we can use the `-f` parameter of the `ps` command.

``` shell
user@machine:~$ ps -f

UID      PID  PPID C STIME    TTY        TIME CMD
1001     19     1 0 07:20    pts/1  00:00:00f     sh
1001     25    19 0 08:04    pts/1  00:00:00      ps -f
```

|Column Name|Description|
|---|---|
|UID|User ID - The ID number of the user running the process|
|PID|Process ID - The unique identifier for the process|
|PPID|Parent Process ID - The unique identifier for the parent process that started the process|
|C|CPU - The CPU usage of the process|
|STIME|Start Time - The start time of the process|
|TTY|Terminal Type - The type of terminal where the process is running|
|TIME|The total time the process has been running|
|CMD|Command - The command that started the process|
To stop process use `kill` command
``` bash
kill 19
```

If the process does not terminate with the command above, we can forcefully stop it with the interrupt signal `-9`.

``` bash
kill -9 19
```
