# Bash and shell scripting flow control
To control a bash flow, you can use if condition, switch cases, or even the exit statements.

## Logical expression
In shell scripting there are three ways to make the logical expression.

- using the `test` keyword
- using the `[ ]` brackets
- using the `[[ ]]` brackets (the double brackets)

### Test
it is using the keyword **test** to make a logical operation (1 or 0)
```bash
# test if the file1 does not exist
[ ! -e file1 ]
test ! -e file1 
```
to see the operation output we have to print the result by
```bash
test 'hi' = 'hello'; echo $?
```
this will result **1**

### Single square bracket [ ]
There is no different between single square bracket and the test keyword.
```bash
[ 'hi' = 'hello' ]; echo $?
```

> The space within the brackets is mandatory so you must add space between the open bracket and before the closed bracket.


### Double square brackets [[ ]]
Both test keyword and the single square bracket [ ] are **POSIX** shell compliant, but the double [[ ]] are an extension to the standard single bracket and they are support extra operations, as well as the standard POSIX operations.
You can read more about it in the [GNU Manual](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Conditional-Constructs)

```bash
[[ 'hi' = 'hello' ]]; echo $?
```

## Logical operation
There is multiple logical operation in bash we will summarize it in the next table.

### Operations for Arguments
| Operation | Details |
|: --------------- |: ---------- |
| -z | Argument is empty |
| -n | Argument in not empty |

```bash
[ -z "" ]; echo $?
# will result zero
[ -n "" ]; echo $?
# will result one

```

### Operations for Strings
| Operation | Details |
|: --------------- |: ---------- |
| = | Equal to |
| != | Not equal to |

```bash
['hello' = 'hi' ]; echo $?
# will result one
[ 'hi' = 'hi' ]; echo $?
# will result zero
```


### Operations for Arithmetic
| Operation | Details |
|: --------------- |: ---------- |
| -eq | Equal to |
| -nq | Not equal to |
| -lt | Less than |
| -gt | Greater than |
| -le | Less than or equal to |
| -ge | Greater than or equal to |


```bash
[ 1 = 1 ]; echo $?
# will result zero
[ 092 = 92 ]; echo $?
# will result one
[ 092 -eq 92 ]; echo $?
# will result zero
```

> Avoid using the string compare "=" to compare the digits, it will look for string equality, not numeric equality.

### Operations for files
| Operation | Details |
|: --------------- |: ---------- |
| -e | File exists |
| -s | File is not empty |
| -r | File permission is readable |
| -w | File permission is writable |
| -x | File permission is executable |
| -u | File uid has been set |
| -g | File group id (gid) has been set |
| -k | File sticky bit has been set |
| -b | File type is block device |
| -c | File type is character device |
| -d | File type is directory |
| -f | File type is regular file |
| -L | File type is symbolic link |
| -O | File type Group matches the effective group id of this process |
| -p | File type is Named pipe |
| -s | File type is Socket |
| -nt | File is newer than |
| -ot | File is older than |
| -ef | File is sharing the inode number |

```bash
touch oldFile.txt
touch newFile.txt
[ oldFile.txt -nt newFile.txt ]; echo $?
# will result one
[ oldFile.txt -ot newFile.txt ]; echo $?
# will result zero
```

## If statements
Like any other language, we can use if, else to handle the logic flow.
```bash
value=2
if [ $value -eq 1 ]; then
 echo "the value is 1"
elif [ $value -eq 2 ]; then
 echo "the value is 2"
else
 echo "the value is unknown"
fi
```
You can make more complex if condition by combining two logic conditions.

```bash
if [ $value -lt 2 ] && [ $value -gt 0 ]; then
  # value is between 0 and 2
fi
```

## Case statements
We can use case to switch between a multiple defined case value, for example, when you have a variable and need to execute lines of code depending on its value.

```bash
echo "Please enter option from 1 to 3 for your prize: "
read -p "your prize num: " input 
case $input in
    1)
    echo "Iphone !!";;
    2|3)
    echo "PC :)";;
    *)
    echo "please enter number from 1 to 3";;
esac
```
> Note the use of the **|** operand to combine two cases
