A machine is said to have artificial intelligence if it can interpret data, potentially learn from the data, and use that knowledge to adapt and achieve specific goals.

It is combination of computing power with a lot of data to learn an AI model to give it the ability to make a decision.

AI is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines that mimic human like intellectual behaviors

Turing test is a testing how much the AI is like Human action.

## AI Versions
The Chat bots we are familiar  AI 1.0:
LLM (Large Language models): 
- Chat GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) 

AI Agents are known as AI 2.0:
Which is including Automation.
AI LLM interact with each other, rather than humans.
