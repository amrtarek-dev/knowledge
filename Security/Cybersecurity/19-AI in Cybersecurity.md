A good prompt follows a simple framework:

	- Persona (to ask the AI act as a profession for a topic)
	- Format (the output format)
Context: the necessary details to help the Gen AI tool understand what you need from it.
References: an examples of the request.
Evaluate: is it the output that you needed?
Iterate: enhance the output.
