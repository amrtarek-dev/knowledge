## Security Controls
Are the safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.
- Technical
- Operational
- Managerial

Technical control types include the many technologies used to protect assets (Encryption, authentication systems, and others).

Operational controls include maintaining the day-to-day security environment (For people). (awareness training and incident response).

Managerial controls are centered around how the other two reduce risks (policies, standards, procedures)

### Information privacy
The protection from the unauthorized access and distribution of data.

### Information security (InfoSec)

##### Data custodian
Anyone or anything that's responsible for the safe handling, transport, and storage of information. (people, organizations, their systems)

Prevent it by privilege audits

##### Account change audits
Account directory service keep records and logs associated with each user 
- Directory service can be configured to alert system administrator of suspicious activity.
