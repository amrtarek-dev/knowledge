Certified Information Systems Security Professional has defined eight domains to organize the work of security professionals.
1. Security and Risk Management
2. Asset Security
3. Security Architecture and Engineering
4. Communications and Network Security
5. Identity and Access Management
6. Security Assessment and Testing
7. Security Operations
8. Software Development Security.

## 1. Security and risk management

Defines security goals and objectives risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law (legal regulations).

i.e:**Social engineering attack**
- Risk mitigation: the process of having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of risk like a breach
- Compliance: is the primary method used to develop an organization's internal security policies, regulatory requirements, and independent standard.
- Business continuity: An organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans.

## 2. Asset Security
This domain focuses on securing digital and physical assets. also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.

i.e: **Physical attack**, **Supply-chain attack**
Assets such as PII or SPII should be securely handled and protected virtually or physically collected.
Policies and procedures that ensure data is properly stored, maintained, retained, and destroyed.


## 3. Security Architecture and Engineering
Optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and process are in place to protect the organization's assets and data.
- Shared Responsibility: All individuals within an organization take an active role in lowering risk and maintaining both physical and virtual security.
Having policies that enables the users to recognize and report security concers.
- Threat modeling
- Least privilege
- Defense in depth
- Fail securely
- Separation of duties
- Keep it simple
- Zero trust
- Trust but verify

## 4. Communications and Network Security
Manage and secure physical networks and wireless communications.

ie. A **password attack**, **Cryptographic attack**
Working remotely employees in public spaces need to be protected from vulnerabilities when using insecure bluetooth or public wifi.

## 5. Identity and Access management (IAM)
Keeps data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications.
i.e: **Adversarial artificial intelligence**
ensure user access is limited to what employees need. to reduce the overall risk to systems and data.
- Identification: User providing who they are by providing a username.
- Authentication: is the verification process to prove a person's identity.
- Authorization: After user identity has been confirmed.
- Accountability: Monitoring and recording user actions to prove systems and data are used properly.
## 6. Security assessment and testing
Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats and vulnerabilities.
- security control testing identify new or better ways to mitigate threats, risks and vulnerabilities. Like using of multi-factor authentication.

## 7. Security operations
Conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.
- Investigation begin once a security incident has been identified.
- If there is an active attack, mitigating the attack and preventing it from escalating further is essential.
- A digital forensic investigation must take place after attack to identify (when, how, why) the breach occured.
using tools such as:
- Training and awareness
- Reporting and documentation
- Intrusion detection and prevention
- SIEM tools   
- Log management
- Incident management
- Playbooks
- Post-breach forensics
- Reflecting on lessons learned
## 8. Software development security
uses secure coding practices, 
which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.
- Performing a secure design review during the design phase
- Secure code reviews during the development and testing phases.
- Penetration testing during the deployment and implementation phase.
