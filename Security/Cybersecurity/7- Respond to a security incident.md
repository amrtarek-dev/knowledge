Using the National Institute of Standard and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)

- **Identify** security risks through regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to identify potential gaps in security. 

- **Protect** internal assets through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats. 

- **Detect** potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections. 

- **Respond** to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents; implement improvements to the security process. 

- **Recover** affected systems to normal operation and restore systems data and/or assets that have been affected by an incident.


Step1: Summarize the security event
Step2: identify the type of attack and the systems affected
Step3: Protect the assets in your organization from being compromised: 
- A plan to protect
- What systems or procedures need to be updated or changed to further secure the organization’s assets?
Step4: Detect similar incidents in the future:
- consider ways you and your team can monitor and analyze network traffic, software applications, track authorized versus unauthorized users, and detect any unusual activity on user accounts. Write your response in the incident response analysis worksheet in the “Detect” section.
Step5: Respond to future cybersecurity incidents:
- How can you and your team contain cybersecurity incidents and affected devices?
- What procedures are in place to help you and your team neutralize cybersecurity incidents?
- What data or information can be used to analyze this incident?
- How can your organization’s recovery process be improved to better handle future cybersecurity incidents?
Step6: Recover from the incident:
- What information do you need to be able to recover immediately? 
- What processes are in place to help the organization recover from the incident?
