an intrusion detection system (IDS) can detect possible intrusions and send out alerts to security analysts to investigate the suspicious activity. 

Security analysts can also use security information and event management (SIEM) tools to detect, collect, and analyze security data.

**Threat hunting** is the proactive search for threats on a network. Security professionals use threat hunting to uncover malicious activity that was not identified by detection tools and as a way to do further analysis on detections.

**threat intelligence** is evidence-based threat information that provides context about existing or emerging threats.

come from private or public sources like:
- **Industry reports**: These often include details about attacker's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).
- **Government advisories:** Similar to industry reports, government advisories include details about attackers' TTP.Â 
- **Threat data feeds**: Threat data feeds provide a stream of threat-related data that can be used to help protect against sophisticated attackers like **advanced persistent threats (APTs)**. APTs are instances when a threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time.

_threat intelligence platform_ (TIP) which is an application that collects, centralizes, and analyzes threat intelligence from different sources.


## **Cyber deception**
Cyber deception involves techniques that deliberately deceive malicious actors with the goal of increasing detection and improving defensive strategies.

**Honeypots** are an example of an active cyber defense mechanism that uses deception technology. Honeypots are systems or resources that are created as decoys vulnerable to attacks with the purpose of attracting potential intruders. For example, having a fake file labeled _Client_ _Credit Card Information - 2022_ can be used to capture the activity of malicious actors by tricking them into accessing the file because it appears to be legitimate. Once a malicious actor tries to access this file, security teams are alerted.
