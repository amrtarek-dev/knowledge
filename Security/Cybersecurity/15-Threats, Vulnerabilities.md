Preparing for attacks is an important job that the entire security team is responsible for.

Threat actors have many tools they can use depending on their target.
- Anticipation attacks is the key to preparing for them in security. (this called threat modeling)
## Threat modeling
It is the process of identifying assets, their vulnerabilities and how each is exposed to threats.
- We apply this modeling to everything we protect (Entire systems, applications or business processes)
- it is lengthy and detailed activity and performed by individuals with years of experience, so it's considered to be an advanced skill in security.

#### Threat modeling 6 steps:
1. Define the scope: Creating an inventory of assets and classifying them.
2. Identify threats: Define all potential threat actors (internal or external)
	1. the output called (Attack tree) that is a diagram that maps treats to assets.
3. Characterize the environment: how the customers and employees interact with the environment.
4. Analyze threats: examine the system protection and identify the gaps and rank the threats according to their risk score.
5. Mitigate risk: a plan to reduce the risks.
6. Evaluate findings: everything that was done is documented, fixes are applied, and can inform how they approach future threat models.

### Treat modeling Frameworks:
- PASTA: Is a popular threat modeling framework that is used across many industries.
- STRIDE
- Trike
- VAST

### **STRIDE** 

STRIDE is a threat-modeling framework developed by Microsoft. It’s commonly used to identify vulnerabilities in six specific attack vectors. The acronym represents each of these vectors: spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege.

### **PASTA**

The **Process of Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis** (PASTA) is a risk-centric threat modeling process developed by two OWASP leaders and supported by a cybersecurity firm called VerSprite. Its main focus is to discover evidence of viable threats and represent this information as a model. PASTA's evidence-based design can be applied when threat modeling an application or the environment that supports that application. Its seven stage process consists of various activities that incorporate relevant security artifacts of the environment, like vulnerability assessment reports.

It is using 7 stages in PASTA:
1. Define business and security objectives
2. Define the technical scope
3. Decompose the application (produce a data flow diagram of the app)
4. Perform a threat analysis (take the attacker mindset)
5. Perform a vulnerability analysis
6. Conduct attack modeling (Attack tree)

### **Trike** 

Trike is an open source methodology and tool that takes a security-centric approach to threat modeling. It's commonly used to focus on security permissions, application use cases, privilege models, and other elements that support a secure environment.

### **VAST**

The Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat (VAST) Modeling framework is part of an automated threat-modeling platform called ThreatModeler®. Many security teams opt to use VAST as a way of automating and streamlining their threat modeling assessments.
