Security plans are based on the analysis of three elements:
1. Assets
2. Threats
3. Vulnerabilities
can effect on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems.

**Risk**: Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an assets.

**Assets**: is an item perceived as having value to an organization.
	- Digital Assets
	- Physical Assets
	- Intangible Assets (brand reputation, intellectual property)

**Threats**: is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.

**Asset management** is the process of tracking assets and the risks that effects them.
- **Asset inventory**: A catalog of assets that need to be protected
- **Asset Classification**: The practice of labeling assets based on sensitivity and importance to an organization.
	- Public (shared with anyone)
	- internal-only (shared with anyone in the orgainzation)
	- confidential (Specific group team)
	- restricted (Specific small group)

### Digital Assets
- Data: Information that is translated, processed, or stored by a computer.
State of data:
- In use (Been accessed by one or more users).
- In transit (Traveling from one point to another).
- At rest (currently not being accessed).


**Vulnerability**: is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat.

## Risk Factors
- Threats
	- Intentional (hacker)
	- Unintentional (employee opens door to someone else)
- Vulnerabilities
	- Technical (misconfiguration)
	- human (employee loses their access card)

A fundamental truth of security is you can only protect the things you account for.
#### Information Security (InfoSec)
The practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users.

## Security Plan
The purpose of the security plan is mitigate the risks

Risk categories:
- Damage
- Disclosure
- Loss of information

To do so the security plan uses 3 elements:
1. Policies: a set of rules to reduce risk and protects information.
	1. Acceptable use policy (AUP)
2. Standards: Are reference to how to set policies.
	1. Password must be 8 characters long (NIST Special Publication 800-63B)
3. Procedures: Step by step instructions to perform a specific security task.
	1. Steps for employees can securely reset a password.


After the security plan is ready there is another part called compliance.

#### Compliance
Is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations.

Meeting compliance standards is usually a continual, two-part process of security audits and assessments:
- A **security audit** is a review of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations.
- A **security assessment** is a check to determine how resilient current security implementations are against threats.

#### Regulations
Rules set by a government or other authority to control the way something is done.

#### NIST (National Institute of Standard and Technology) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):
is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.
It has 3 components:
1. Core: A simplified version of the functions, duties of a security plan. the 5 functions:
	1. Identify
	2. Protect
	3. Detect
	4. Respond
	5. Recover
2. Tiers: Provide security teams with a way to measure performance across each of five functions of core, range from level-1 to 4
	1. level-1 (Passive): indicates a function is reaching bare minimum standards.
	2. level-2
	3. level-3
	4. level-4 (Adaptive): indicates that a function is being performed at an exemplary standard.
3. Profiles: Provide insights into the current state of a security plan. (photo capturing a moment of time.)


#### CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency)
it provide detailed guidance that any organization can use to implement the CSF.
- **Create a current profile** of the security operations and outline the specific needs of your business.
- **Perform a risk assessment** to identify which of your current operations are meeting business and regulatory standards.
- **Analyze and prioritize existing gaps** in security operations that place the businesses assets at risk.
- **Implement a plan of action** to achieve your organizationâ€™s goals and objectives.

> Always consider current risk, threat, and vulnerability trends when using the NIST CSF.
