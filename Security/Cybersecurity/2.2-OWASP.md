Open Web Applications Security Project.
Security Principles:
- **Minimize the attack surface area**: All the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit.
- **Principle of least privilege**: Insures that users have the least amount of access required.
- **Defense in depth**: An on organization should have multiple security control.
- **Separation of duties**: No one should be given so many privileges that they can misuse the system.
- **Keep security simple**: implement the security control without unnecessary complexity to make it manageable.
- **Fix the security issues correctly**: When security incidents occur, identify the root cause, contain the impact, identify vulnerabilities, and conduct tests to ensure that remediation is successful.

-  **Establish secure defaults**: optimal security state of an application is also its default state for users
-  **Fail securely**: when a firewall fails it should simply close all connections and block all new ones, rather than start accepting everything.
-  **Don’t trust services**: the organization shouldn’t explicitly trust that their partners’ systems are secure
- **Avoid security by obscurity**: security of an application should not rely on keeping the source code secret, Its security should rely upon many other factors, including reasonable password policies, defense in depth, business transaction limits, solid network architecture, and fraud and audit controls.
