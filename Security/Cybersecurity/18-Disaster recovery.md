Creating business continuity and disaster recovery plans are the final steps of a four-part process that most security teams go through to help ensure the security of an organization.

1. security team identifies the assets that must be protected in the organization
2. determine what potential threats could negatively impact those assets
3. the security team implements tools and processes to detect potential threats to assets
4. IT or appropriate business function creates the business continuity and disaster recovery plans

## Business continuity plan

A **business continuity plan** is a document that outlines the procedures to sustain business operations during and after a significant disruption.

It is created alongside a disaster recovery plan to minimize the damage of a successful security attack.

By 4 essential steps:
1. **Conduct a business impact analysis.** The business impact analysis step focuses on the possible effects a disruption of business functions can have on an organization.
2. **Identify, document, and implement steps to recover critical business functions and processes.** This step helps the business continuity team create actionable steps toward responding to a security event.
3. **Organize a business continuity team.** This step brings various members of the organization together to help execute the business continuity plan.
4. **Conduct training for the business continuity team**. The team considers different risk scenarios and prepares for security threats during these training exercises.

## Disaster recovery plan
A **disaster recovery plan** allows an organization’s security team to outline the steps needed to minimize the impact of a security incident, such as a successful ransomware attack that has stopped the manufacturing team from retrieving certain data.

disaster recovery plan should include:
- Implementing recovery strategies to restore software
- Implementing recovery strategies to restore hardware functionality
- Identifying applications and data that might be impacted after a security incident has taken place


**Escalation policy** is a set of actions that outlines who should be notified when an incident alert occurs and how that incident should be handled.

**Improper usage:** An incident type that occurs when an employee of an organization violates the organization’s acceptable use policies

**Incident escalation**: The process of identifying a potential security incident, triaging it, and handing it off to a more experienced team member

**Malware infection**: An incident type that occurs when malicious software designed to disrupt a system infiltrates an organization’s computers or network

**Unauthorized access:** An incident type that occurs when an individual gains digital or physical access to a system or an application without permission

## Stakeholders
- **Risk manager**  is a professional responsible for leading efforts to identify, assess, and mitigate security risks within an organization.
- **Chief Executive Officer (CEO)** is the highest ranking person in an organization. You are unlikely to communicate directly with this stakeholder as an entry-level analyst.
- **Chief Financial Office (CFO)**
- **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**
- **Operation Managers** oversees the day-to-day security operations. These individuals lead teams related to the development and implementation of security strategies that protect an organization from cyber threats.
Operations managers and risk managers are stakeholders who rely on entry-level analysts and other team members to keep them informed of security events in day-to-day operations. These stakeholders commonly report back to the CISOs and CFOs to give a broader narrative of the organization's overall security picture.


To get to the point in your communications, ask yourself: 
- What do I want this person to know? 
- Why is it important for them to know it? 
- When do they need to take action?
- How do I explain the situation in a nontechnical manner?

Here are a few ways you might choose to communicate:
- Instant messaging
- Emailing
- Video calling
- Phone calls
- Sharing a spreadsheet of data
- Sharing a slideshow presentation
