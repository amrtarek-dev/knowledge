Networks are constantly at risk of attack from malicious hackers.
- Malware
- Spoofing
- Packet sniffing
- Packet flooding

Backdoor attack:
Backdoors are weaknesses intentionally left by programmer or system and network administrators that bypass normal access control mechanisms.

Backdoors can also be installed by the attackers after they've compromised an organization to ensure they have persistent access.

Denial of Service(DoS) attack is an attack that targets a network or server and floods it with network traffic.

Attacker can harm an organization by:
- Leaking valuable or confidential information
- Damaging an organization's reputation
- Impacting customer retention
- Costing money and time

Possible Impact on an organization:
- Financial: By DoS
- Reputation: if the attack becomes public, the customer may stop trusting the company.
- Public safety: if the attack on a government network (public water system, military defense communication system).

## Denial of service attack (DoS)
An attack that targets a network or server and floods it with network traffic.
To Disrupt the normal organization operation by over loading the network. (Availability and Accessability)

## Distributed denial of service attack (DDoS)
A type of denial of service attack that uses multiple devices or services in different locations to flood the target network with unwanted traffic.

### Network level DoS attack:
- SYN (Synchronize) flood attack: 
by simulates the TCP connection and floods the server with SYN packets.

At the connection handshake between a device and server, the first step in the handshake is for the device to send a SYN (Synchronize) request to the sercer.
Then server will responds with a SYN/ACK packet to acknowledge the receipt of the device's request and leaves a port open for the final step of the handshake.
Then the device has to send the ACK package to establish a TCP connection.

But the hacker send a flood of SYN request more than the number of server ports available, the server will hang and become unable to function.

- Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
An internet protocol used by devices to tell each other about data transmission errors across the network.
It is a status update from the device if there is an error concern.
ICMP flood attack: is a type of DoS attack performed by an attacker repeatedly sending ICMP packets to a network server, which will false the server to send an ICMP packet and this will consume all the bandwidth of the Network incoming and outgoing traffic, or crash the server.

- Ping of death
A type of DoS attack caused when a hacker pings a system by sending it a oversized ICMP packet that is bigger than 64KB(Maximum size of the ICMP packet).

## TCP dump
A network protocol analyzer (Packet Sniffer) is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network.
- SolarWinds NetFlow Traffic Analyzer
- ManageEngine OpManager
- Azure Network Watcher
- Wireshark
- tcpdump


tcpdump is a command line network protocol analyzer (lightweigh, uses open-source library libpcap)

The captured packets have:
- Timestamp
- Source IP.Source port
- Destination IP.Destination port
By default tcpdump will try to resolve the host address and port numbers with the associated service

Network Interface Card (NIC) is a hardware that connect the device to a network and it contains the device's MAC address.
NIC can be set to promiscuous mode, which means that it accepts all traffic on the network.
So malicious actors might use software like wireshark to capture the data on a private network and store it.


## Packet sniffing
hacker can use a software or hardware packet sniffer and change the data (body of the packet)
- Passive packet sniffing: where data packets are read in transit (no change for the data, only reading)
- Active packet sniffing: where data packets are manipulated in transit.

Can be prevented by VPN, because the data packet is encrypted and encapsulated.
Use Https web site.
Do not use the unprotected WiFi.


## Ip Spoofing
A network attack performed when the attacker changes the source IP of a data packet to impersonate an authorized system and gain access to a network. (to pass firewall for example).
Common IP Spoofing attacks:
- On-path attack
- Replay attack
- Smurf attack

On-path attack (**meddler-in-the middle attack**)
An attack where malicious actor places themselves in the middle of an authorized connection and intercepts or alters the data in transit.

Replay attack
A network attack performed when a malicious actor intercepts a data packet in transit and delays it or repeats it at another time.

Smurf attack
Combination of DoS attack and Spoofing attack, when an attacker sniffs an authorized user's IP address and floods it with packets.
Once the spoofed packet reaches the broadcast address, it is sent to all of the devices and servers on the network.

To prevent these attacks:
- Encryption
- Firewalls (reject all packets that coming from internet with a local network IP)
