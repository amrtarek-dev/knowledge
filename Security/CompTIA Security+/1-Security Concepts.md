Security risks are out there, assets are varied, so to prevent security events and minimize the impact and limit the damage we need security controls.

## Security controls

Security controls has multiple categories:
- Technical controls: control we implement using some type of technical system.
	- Operating system control
	- Firewalls, antivirus
- Managerial controls: Policies and procedures
	- Administrative controls associated with security design and implementation
	- Security policies, standard operating procedures.
	- ex: On-boarding policy
- Operational controls:
	- Controls implemented by people instead of systems
	- Security guards, awareness programs
- Physical controls:
	- Limit physical access
	- Guard shack
	- Fences, locks
	- Badge readers

## CIA or AIC Triad
It is a security objectives of cybersecurity
- Availability
	- By Redundancy, fault tolerance, patching 
- Integrity: original data, from the original source
	- By Hashing, Digital signatures (hash + encrypted with asymmetric encryption algorithm), certificates, Non-repudiation.
- Confidentiality: (AAA)
	- By Encryption, Access controls, 2FA (two-factor authentication)

### Confidentiality
we can use the **AAA framework** for that
- Authentication (who you are)
- Authorization (what you can use from the resources)
- Accounting (what you did with the resources)
	- Login time, data sent and received, logout time.

### Integrity
### Non-repudiation
You can't deny what you've said

By sign a contract:
- your signature (private key)
- Others can see your signature (verified by the public key)
