Cryptography’s ultimate purpose is to ensure _secure communication in the presence of adversaries_. The term secure includes confidentiality and integrity of the communicated data. Cryptography can be defined as the practice and study of techniques for secure communication and data protection where we expect the presence of adversaries and third parties. In other words, these adversaries should not be able to disclose or alter the contents of the messages.

Cryptography is used to protect confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

- When you connect over SSH, your SSH client and the server establish an encrypted tunnel so no one can eavesdrop on your session.
- When you conduct online banking, your browser checks the remote server’s certificate to confirm that you are communicating with your bank’s server and not an attacker’s.
- When you download a file, how do you check if it was downloaded correctly? Cryptography provides a solution through hash functions to confirm that your file is identical to the original one.

As you can see, you rarely have to interact directly with cryptography, but its solutions and implications are everywhere in the digital world.
