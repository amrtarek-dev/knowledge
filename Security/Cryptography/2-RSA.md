The RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) cryptosystem is a family of public-key cryptosystems, one of the oldest widely used for secure data transmission. The initialism "RSA" comes from the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who publicly described the algorithm in 1977.

RSA is based on the mathematically difficult problem of factoring a large number. Multiplying two large prime numbers is a straightforward operation; however, finding the factors of a huge number takes much more computing power.

 RSA algorithm in action:

1. Bob chooses two prime numbers: _p_ = 157 and _q_ = 199. 
   He calculates _n_ = _p_ × _q_ = 31243.
2. With _ϕ_(_n_) = _n_ − _p_ − _q_ + 1 = 31243 − 157 − 199 + 1 = 30888, 
   Bob selects _e_ = 163 such that _e_ is relatively prime to _ϕ_(_n_); 
   moreover, 
   he selects _d_ = 379, where _e_ × _d_ = 1 mod _ϕ_(_n_), i.e., _e_ × _d_ = 163 × 379 = 61777 and 61777 mod 30888 = 1. 
   The public key is (_n_,_e_), i.e., (31243,163) and the private key is $(n,d), i.e., (31243,379).
3. Let’s say that the value they want to encrypt is _x_ = 13, 
   then Alice would calculate and send _y_ = x^e mod _n_ => 13^163 mod 31243 = 16341.
4. Bob will decrypt the received value by calculating _x_ = y^d mod _n_ => 16341^379 mod 31243 = 13. 
   This way, Bob recovers the value that Alice sent.

You need to know the main variables for RSA in CTFs: p, q, m, n, e, d, and c. As per our numerical example:

- p and q are large prime numbers
- n is the product of p and q
- The public key is n and e
- The private key is n and d
- m is used to represent the original message, i.e., plaintext
- c represents the encrypted text, i.e., ciphertext
