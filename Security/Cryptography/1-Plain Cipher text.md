- **Plaintext** is the original, readable message or data before it’s encrypted. It can be a document, an image, a multimedia file, or any other binary data.
- **Ciphertext** is the scrambled, unreadable version of the message after encryption. Ideally, we cannot get any information about the original plaintext except its approximate size.
- **Cipher** is an algorithm or method to convert plaintext into ciphertext and back again. A cipher is usually developed by a mathematician.
- **Key** is a string of bits the cipher uses to encrypt or decrypt data. In general, the used cipher is public knowledge; however, the key must remain secret unless it is the public key in asymmetric encryption. We will visit asymmetric encryption in a later task.
- **Encryption** is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using a cipher and a key. Unlike the key, the choice of the cipher is disclosed.
- **Decryption** is the reverse process of encryption, converting ciphertext back into plaintext using a cipher and a key. Although the cipher would be public knowledge, recovering the plaintext without knowledge of the key should be impossible (infeasible).
