important science that studies how to break or bypass cryptographic systems.
As for trying every possible password combination, we call that a **brute-force attack**. 

However, when we know that the password is most likely a dictionary word, it will make more sense to try words from a dictionary instead of every possible password combination; this is called a **dictionary attack**.

- **Cryptography** is the science of securing communication and data using codes and ciphers.
- **Cryptanalysis** is the study of methods to break or bypass cryptographic security systems without knowing the key.
- **Brute-Force Attack** is an attack method that involves trying every possible key or password to decrypt a message.
- **Dictionary Attack** is an attack method where the attacker tries dictionary words or combinations of them.
