Perfect 👍 thanks for clarifying. Since your goal is **Application Security (AppSec)**, the smart path is:

1. **Start with the basics (infosec foundations + beginner cyber)**
    
2. **Move into penetration testing skills (offensive security)**
    
3. **Apply them to applications (AppSec focus)**
    

Here’s a **step-by-step roadmap** you can follow 👇

---

## 🚀 Step 1 – Foundations (Beginner Cybersecurity)

You need to understand the fundamentals before hacking apps.

- **CompTIA Security+** (very good entry cert; covers networks, risks, cryptography)
    
- **Free Option:** [Coursera – Introduction to Cybersecurity Specialization (IBM)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-cyber-security)
    
- **Hands-on Option:** TryHackMe “Pre Security” + “Complete Beginner” paths
    

✅ Outcome: You understand how systems and networks work, common attacks, and security basics.

---

## 🛠 Step 2 – Penetration Testing (Offensive Skills)

Now you build **attacker mindset** to test systems & apps.

- **CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)** – optional, good for HR recognition but shallow.
    
- **Better Path:**
    
    - TryHackMe Penetration Testing Learning Path
        
    - HackTheBox Labs for real-world hacking practice
        
    - **Certification Goal:** OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) → industry respected
        

✅ Outcome: You can scan, exploit, and report vulnerabilities like a real pentester.

---

## 🔒 Step 3 – Application Security (AppSec Focus)

Here you pivot from general pentesting → **web apps, APIs, and secure coding**.

- **Key Resources:**
    
    - OWASP Top 10 (must know!)
        
    - PortSwigger Web Security Academy (100% free, hands-on labs)
        
    - [TryHackMe Web Fundamentals + Advanced Web Hacking]
        
    - Learn Secure Coding: e.g. SQLi, XSS, CSRF, RCE, SSRF
        
- **Certifications (optional but powerful):**
    
    - eLearnSecurity **eWPT** (Web App Penetration Tester)
        
    - SANS GWAPT (if budget allows)
        

✅ Outcome: You can assess and secure **apps, APIs, and codebases**.

## 🎯 Suggested Learning Timeline

- **Months 1–2:** Security+ + TryHackMe Pre-Security → basics covered
    
- **Months 3–5:** Pentesting labs (THM, HTB) → offensive skills
    
- **Months 6–8:** AppSec labs (PortSwigger, OWASP) → web/app focus
    
- **Months 9+ (optional):** Go for OSCP or eWPT if you want certification strength

👉 With this route, you’ll **speak both the developer’s language and the hacker’s language**, which is exactly what makes a strong Application Security Engineer.
