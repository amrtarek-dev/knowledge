- Known-plaintext attack: Attacker has knowledge of some part of the plain text, using this information the key used to generate chiphertext is deduced to decipher other messages.

- Chosen-ciphertext Attack: Attacker obtains plaintext corresponding to an arbitrary set of ciphertexts of their own choosing.

- Rubber Hose Attack: Extraction of cryptographic secrets (e.g, the password to an encrypted file) from a person by coercion or torture

- Chosen-key Attack: Attacker usually breaks an n bit key cipher into 2 power n/2 operations

- Timing Attack: it is based on repeatedly measuring the exact execution times of modular exponentiation operations.

- MITM Attack: Attacker perform this attack on the public key cryptosystems where key exchange is required before communication takes place.

- Brute-force attack: try every kind of combination until get the correct one.

- Birthday Attack: is the name used to refer to a class of brute-force attacks against cryptographic hashes that makes the brute forcing easier (when 2 plain password give the same hash) in the non collision resistant algorithm.
