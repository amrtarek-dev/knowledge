### Type of Inheritance
Access specifiers are also to specify the type of inheritance:
- **Public Inheritance** (Recommended): public members of the base class become public member of the derived class and protected member of the base class become the protected members of the derived class, Private members are never accessible from the derived class.
- **Protected Inheritance**: Public and protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived class.
- **Private Inheritance** (Default): Public and protected members of the base class become private members of the derived class.

## Inheritance Levels
C++ support multiple inheritance, that means a single class can inherit multiple classes.
