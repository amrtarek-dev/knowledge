Before C++11, you had to manage memory explicitly, leading to potential memory leaks and dangling pointers.
## `new` Operator
The `new` operator allocates memory for an object or array of objects from the heap and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.

It also calls the constructor if you're allocating an object of a class.
``` cpp
// Allocates memory for a single integer
int* ptr = new int; 

// Allocates memory for an array of 10 integers
int* arr = new int[10];

// Allocates memory and calls the constructor for MyClass
MyClass* obj = new MyClass();
```

## `delete` Operator
The `delete` operator deallocates memory that was previously allocated with `new`.
If you allocated an array with `new[]`, you must use `delete[]` to deallocate it.

``` cpp
// Deallocates memory for a single integer
delete ptr;

// Deallocates memory for an array
delete[] arr;

// Deallocates memory and calls the destructor for MyClass
delete obj;
```

>**Memory Leaks:** Always ensure to deallocate memory with `delete` to avoid memory leaks.
>Deleting a null pointer (`nullptr`) is safe and has no effect.
>Always match `new` with `delete` and `new[]` with `delete[]`.

## Smart Pointers
they manage the lifetime of dynamically allocated objects, ensuring that memory is automatically deallocated when no longer needed.

They help avoid manual memory management mistakes such as memory leaks, dangling pointers, and double deletion.

They are 3 primary types of smart pointers:
- std::unique_ptr
- std::shared_ptr
- std::weak_ptr

### unique_ptr
it represents exclusive ownership of an object, only one `unique_ptr` can points to a specific object at any time.

When the `unique_ptr` goes out of scope or is explicitly reset, the objects is destroyed, and the memory is freed.

It cannot be copied but can be moved to transfer ownership.
``` cpp
// Create a unique_ptr
std::unique_ptr<int> ptr1 = std::make_unique<int>(10);

// Transfer ownership from ptr1 to ptr2
std::unique_ptr<int> ptr2 = std::move(ptr1);
```


### shared_ptr
it allows **shared ownership** of an object. Multiple `shared_ptr` instances can point to the same object, and the object is only destroyed when the last `shared_ptr` goes out of scope.

It uses a reference counter to track how many `shared_ptr` point to the object, and when the counter reaches zero, the object is destroyed.

``` cpp
 // Create a shared_ptr
std::shared_ptr<int> sptr1 = std::make_shared<int>(20);

 // Shared ownership
std::shared_ptr<int> sptr2 = sptr1;
```

### weak_ptr
It works with `shared_ptr` to prevent circular references. 
A `weak_ptr` doesn't increase the reference count, and it doesn't own the object.

You can use `lock()` to access the object (as a `shared_ptr`) if it still exists.

``` cpp
std::shared_ptr<int> sptr = std::make_shared<int>(30);

// Doesn't increase reference count
std::weak_ptr<int> wptr = sptr;
```

## RAII
**RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**: A technique in C++ where resource management (e.g., memory, file handles) is tied to object lifetimes, ensuring that resources are released when objects go out of scope.
- **Resource Acquisition:** When an object is constructed, it acquires some resources (e.g., memory, file, network socket).
- **Resource Release:** When the object goes out of scope (is destroyed), the destructor automatically releases the resource.

Modern C++ uses **move semantics** (`move constructor` and `move assignment operator`) to efficiently transfer resources between objects.

##  Move semantics
it is allowing the transfer of resources from one object to another without copying the data.
Move semantics are invoked when:
- Returning large objects from a function.
- Passing temporary objects (rvalues) to a function.
- Assigning or initializing from an rvalue.

### Rvalue and Lvalue
- **Lvalue**: An object that has a name and a persistent address (e.g., variables).
- **Rvalue**: A temporary object without a persistent address (e.g., result of an expression or literal).

``` cpp
void foo(int& lvalue) {
    // lvalue reference
}

void foo(int&& rvalue) {
    // rvalue reference - can be moved
}

int x = 10;
foo(x);       // Calls lvalue version
foo(20);      // Calls rvalue version
foo(std::move(x)); // Turns x into an rvalue, calls rvalue version

```

Prior to C++11, passing objects by value or returning them by value involved copying data, which could be slow for large objects.

Move semantics solve this problem by introducing **move constructors** and **move assignment operators**, which "move" the resource rather than copying it.

``` cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>  // for std::move

class MyClass {
private:
    int* data;  // Dynamic resource (heap memory)

public:
    // Constructor
    MyClass(int value) : data(new int(value)) {
        std::cout << "Constructor: Resource acquired for " << *data << std::endl;
    }

    // Move Constructor
    MyClass(MyClass&& other) noexcept : data(other.data) {
        other.data = nullptr;  // Leave the source object in a valid state
        std::cout << "Move Constructor: Resource moved" << std::endl;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~MyClass() {
        if (data) {
            std::cout << "Destructor: Resource released for " << *data << std::endl;
            delete data;
        } else {
            std::cout << "Destructor: No resource to release" << std::endl;
        }
    }

    // Move Assignment Operator
    MyClass& operator=(MyClass&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete data;            // Release existing resource
            data = other.data;      // Steal other's resource
            other.data = nullptr;   // Reset the other object
            std::cout << "Move Assignment: Resource moved" << std::endl;
        }
        return *this;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj1(10);                // Regular construction
    MyClass obj2 = std::move(obj1);  // Move construction
    MyClass obj3(20);                // Another object
    obj3 = std::move(obj2);          // Move assignment
}
```
