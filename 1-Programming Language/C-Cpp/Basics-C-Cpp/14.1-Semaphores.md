# Semaphores
Semaphores are a synchronisation primitive used in concurrent programming to control access to shared resources. 

They are typically used in multi-threaded or multi-process environments to coordinate and manage the execution of threads or processes. 

Semaphores were introduced by **Edsger Dijkstra** in the context of solving the critical section problem.

## In C and C++
In C and C++, semaphores are often implemented using platform-specific APIs or libraries.

The standard C library does not provide direct support for semaphores, but many operating systems and libraries offer their own implementations. 

For example, on Unix-like systems, you might use the **POSIX** semaphore functions (sem_init, sem_wait, sem_post, etc.).

## Semaphore Basics

A semaphore is a counter that can be incremented or decremented, There are two types of semaphores: 
- **Binary semaphores** (0 or 1) and 
- **Counting semaphores** (can take any non-negative integer value).

Operations on semaphores typically include **initialization**, **incrementing** (release), and **decrementing** (acquire).

## When using Semaphore

Semaphore can be used in 4 situations:

- Mutex (Mutual Exclusion):

Semaphores can be used to implement mutual exclusion, ensuring that only one thread or process accesses a critical section of code at a time. This helps prevent data corruption due to concurrent access.

- Producer-Consumer Problem:

Semaphores can be used to solve synchronization issues in scenarios where one or more producer threads generate data, and one or more consumer threads consume the data.

- Resource Pool Management:

Semaphores can be used to manage a pool of resources (e.g., connections, threads, or memory blocks), ensuring that the number of available resources is controlled.

- Synchronization Between Processes:

Semaphores can be used to synchronize communication and resource sharing between different processes.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <semaphore.h>

sem_t mutex;

void* thread_function(void* arg) {
    // Critical section entry
    sem_wait(&mutex);

    // Critical section
    printf("Thread %ld in critical section\n", (long)arg);

    // Critical section exit
    sem_post(&mutex);

    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    // Initialize semaphore
    sem_init(&mutex, 0, 1);

    pthread_t threads[5];

    // Create threads
    for (long i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, thread_function, (void*)i);
    }

    // Join threads
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
    }

    // Destroy semaphore
    sem_destroy(&mutex);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the **sem_wait** and **sem_post** functions are used to protect the critical section from concurrent execution by multiple threads.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <chrono>

std::mutex mtx;  // Mutex for critical section
const int num_threads = 5;

void threadFunction(int id) {
    // Critical section entry
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);

    // Critical section
    std::cout << "Thread " << id << " in critical section" << std::endl;

    // Simulate some work
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));

    // Critical section exit (lock automatically released when 'lock' goes out of scope)
}

int main() {
    std::thread threads[num_threads];

    // Create threads
    for (int i = 0; i < num_threads; ++i) {
        threads[i] = std::thread(threadFunction, i);
    }

    // Join threads
    for (int i = 0; i < num_threads; ++i) {
        threads[i].join();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code is similar to the previous C example but is adapted for C++. 

Note that C++11 and later standards provide additional features for concurrent programming, such as **std::thread** and improved support for synchronization primitives.

If you are using C++20 or later, you can also use the **<semaphore>** header to directly work with semaphores.

The C++ standard library provides the **std::counting_semaphore** class for counting semaphores.

Keep in mind that not all compilers and environments may fully support C++20 features at the time of writing.
