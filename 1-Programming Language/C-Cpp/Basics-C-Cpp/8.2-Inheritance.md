## Inheritance `:`
Inheritance allows a new class (derived class) to inherit properties and behavior from an existing class (base class).
``` cpp
class BaseClass {
public:
    int baseNumber;
};

class DerivedClass : public BaseClass {
public:
    int derivedNumber;
};
```

## With initialisation List

``` cpp
#include <iostream>

class Base {
    int value;
public:
    Base(int v) : value(v) {
        std::cout << "Base class initialized with value: " << value << std::endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
    int derivedValue;
public:
    // Derived class initialization list also calls Base class constructor
    Derived(int baseVal, int derivedVal) : Base(baseVal), derivedValue(derivedVal) {
        std::cout << "Derived class initialized with derivedValue: " << derivedValue << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj(10, 20);
    return 0;
}
```
### Constructor and Destructor
In inheritance the order of constructor call is `Base` -> `Derived` and the revers in Destructor `Derived` -> `Base`

``` cpp
#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
  
// Base class 
class Base {    
    
    public: 
    Base(){
      cout << "Base class default constructor!" << endl;
    }
    ~Base(){
      cout << endl << "Base class Destructor!" ;
    }
}; 
  
  
// Derived class 
class Derived : public Base { 
    public:  
    Derived(){
      cout << "Derived class default constructor!" << endl;
    }
    ~Derived(){
      cout << endl << "Derived class Destructor!" ;
    }
}; 
  
// main function 
int main() {    
    // creating object of Derived Class 
    Derived obj;
} 
```

The output will be 
``` bash
Base class default constructor!
Derived class default constructor!

Derived class Destructor! 
Base class Destructor!
```

## Function Overriding
When a derived class inherits from a base class, it may choose to change some of the inherited functionality.
This consider a `Run-time Polymorphism`

``` cpp
#include <iostream>

// Base class
class Animal {
public:
    // Virtual function to be overridden
    virtual void sound() {
        std::cout << "Animal makes a sound!" << std::endl;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    // Override the base class method
    void sound() override {
        std::cout << "Dog barks!" << std::endl;
    }
};
```

To override a method, the signature of the overridden method of the base class has to match exactly.

## `virtual`
You use the `virtual` keyword when you want to allow derived classes to **override** a base class function to provide their own implementation, while ensuring that the **correct function is called at runtime** based on the actual object type, not the type of the pointer or reference.

``` cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void speak() { std::cout << "Base speaking\n"; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void speak() override { std::cout << "Derived speaking\n"; }
};

Base* obj = new Derived();
obj->speak(); // Calls Derived's speak() due to virtual function
```

overriding a `virtual` function in a derived class is **optional**. If the derived class doesn't override the virtual function, the base class's version of the function will be used when the function is called.

``` cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void speak() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void speak() override { std::cout << "Derived speaking\n"; } // Must override
};

```

>In this case, `Derived` **must** override `speak()`; otherwise, it will be abstract and cannot be instantiated.

## `final`
`final`Â supports two use cases. 
1. we can declare a method that cannot be overridden.
2. we can define a class that cannot be derived from

> We can not use `virtual` and `final` together on the same function.
