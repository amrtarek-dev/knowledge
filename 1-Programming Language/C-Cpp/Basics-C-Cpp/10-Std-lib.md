# What is C++ the Standard C++ library?

C++ Library is a library of code described by the C++ standard, and it delivers the standard implementation of C++, and it comes with two standard libraries: the old C library (Libc.lib), and the new C++ library (libcp.lib), so in simple words its a collection of classes and functions which are written in the core language, and it is updated every new standard for C++ every 3 years.

So, STD (Standard Library) does not refer to one library file but a collection, and it has been enhanced and incremented with every C++ version.

- The first C++ standard (C++98) the **std** has:
    - **STL** (Standard Template Library) that containers and algorithms
    - Strings library < string >
    - I/O streams
- Then in (C++11) in 2011 the **std** extended to have:
    - Regular expressions
    - Lambda Expressions
    - nullptr
    - Smart pointers
    - Move semantics and rvlaue reference
    - constexpr
    - Hash tables
    - Random numbers
    - Time Library
    - Multithreading 
- Then in (C++14)  in 2014:
    - Improved Smart pointers
    - Improved Multithreading
    - Binary Literals: 0b1010
    - make_unique
    - Adding Tuples, and type traits.
- Then in (C++17) in 2017:
    - Adding String view
    - Parallel Algorithm in the STL(Standard Template Library).
    - Filesystem Library
    - std::any, std::optional, and std::variant types.

## Start with C++ STD
So the C++ standard library is a system library that already comes with your compiler package, 
and any call needs **std** namespace from the standard library and by default, the C++ linker links the std library.

c++ version (C++11, C++14, etc) specify which functions and classes is already in this std.


``` cpp
#include <iostram>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello\n";
    std::cout << "Hello world" << "\n";
    return 0;
}

```
it has  in general two parts:
- The old library from **C language** called **C STD**
- The new library from **C++ Language** called **C++ STL**

The two parts are updating every C++ standard release.

## C STD
The old library keeps being updated with the **great number of functions and macros supporting a broad scope of functionalities** that are related to the old C language and C++ does not duplicate the functionality of the standard C library, it uses the standard C library for many common functions like:
- the C String library  < cstring >
- the C Math library < cmath >

You can note that it always starts with c, and you can find the full list in the cplusplus reference here [C library](https://cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/). Each header from the C Standard Library is included in the C++ Standard Library under a different name, generated by removing the .h, and adding a 'c' at the start; for example, 'time.h' becomes 'ctime'.

```cpp
#include <string.h> // the C header version.
#include <cstring>  // the C++ version.
```


So for example to use `printf` function which is defined in `stdio.h` header in C language, the C++ version from it is in `cstdio` header.

``` cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() 
{
	printf("Hello world from C++");
	return 0;
}
```

### Strings

Strings was already added to C++ in C++ 98 and it is defined in the `<string>` header. It provides a dynamic, flexible, and safer alternative to C-style strings (`char[]`).
The `std::string` class manages memory automatically, allows for a wide range of string manipulation functions, and avoids many of the pitfalls of C-style strings, like buffer overflows.

``` cpp
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::string str = "Hello"; // From a C-string
	
	char ch = str[1]; // 'e' 
	char ch2 = str.at(1); // 'e', with bounds checking
	
	std::string str2(str); // Copy constructor
	std::string str3 = str1 + " World"; // Concatenation
	
	std::cout << str.size() << std::endl; // Output: 5
	std::cout << str.capacity() << std::endl; // Capacity (can be greater than 5)
	
	std::string str = "Hello World";
	
	str.append("!");             // "Hello World!"
	
	std::string sub = str.substr(0, 5); // "Hello"
	
	size_t pos = str.find("World");     // Returns index of "World"
	
	str.replace(6, 5, "C++");     // "Hello C++!"
	
	const char* cStr = cppStr.c_str(); // Convert to C-style string (const char*)
	
	for (auto it = str.begin(); it != str.end(); ++it) 
	{
	    std::cout << *it;  // Output each character
	}
}
```

### InputOutput Stream

The `<iostream>` header was introduced as part of the **C++ standard library** in **C++98** (the first ISO standard of C++).
`<iostream>` is a C++ header that provides facilities for **input and output** (I/O) operations.
It defines objects, functions, and manipulators to handle streams for reading from and writing to standard input (`cin`), standard output (`cout`), and standard error (`cerr`).

``` cpp
#include <iosstream>

int main()
{
	int age;
	std::cin >> age;
	std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
	std::cerr << "Error occurred!" << std::endl;
	std::clog << "Logging information..." << std::endl;
}
```

### StringStream

`std::stringstream` is a powerful tool in C++ for **working with strings as if they were streams** (like `std::cin` and `std::cout`). 
It's particularly useful when you need to **convert between strings and other data types** or **parse data** from a string.

``` cpp
#include <sstream>
#include <iostream>

int main
{
	// Convert string to number
	std::string input = "123";
	int number;	
	std::stringstream ss(input);
	ss >> number; // converts string "123" to int 123
	
	// Convert number to string
	int num = 456;
	ss << num; // Insert interger into the stream
	std::string str = ss.str(); //convert the stream to string

	// String parsing
	std::string sentence = "Hello world C++";
	std::stringstream ss(sentence);
	std::string word;
	// Output each word on a new line
	while(ss >> word){
		std::cout << word << std::endl; 
	}

	// CSV parsing
	std::string line = "John,25,180";
	std::stringstream ss(line);

	string name;
	int age, height;
	char comma;
	ss >> name >> comma;
	ss >> age >> comma;
	ss >> height >> comma;

	// String concatenate
	int a = 10;
	float b = 3.14;
	std::string text = "Number:";

	std::stringstream ss;
	ss << text << " " << a << ", Pi: " << b;
	std::string result = ss.str();
	std::cout << result << std::endl;

	// it will scape the new line for previous input.
	std::cin.ignore();
	// Will get the full line with spaces
	std::getline(std::cin, result);
	// using <iomanip> to set the precision for after the float point to 1 (0.0)
	std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(1) << result << endl;
}
```

`std::stringstream` (from `<sstream>`) builds on the concept of I/O streams provided by `<iostream>`, but it operates on **strings** rather than console I/O. This allows treating strings like input/output streams.
