 C++ or Cpp is a human language (**High-level language**) that people can read and understand but it needs a translator (**Compiler**) to convert it to machine language that the machine (**ex: Computer**) can understand and execute.
## Why it called C++
To answer this question we need to know that it was not the first language invented to program machines, but actually, in **1969** Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson developed **"B"** language at Bell Labs then in **1971** Dennis Ritchie started to improve **B** language and he called it **New B** or **NB** to write the **Unix kernel** and he added a great feature to it like **int**, **char** data type, **arrays**, and **pointers** than in **1973** the **B** language renamed to **C** language and **struct** data type and **preprocessor** features have been added to it, in **1978** Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the first edition of the C programming language, in **1979** Bjarne Stroustrup began work on **C with Classes** to add new features like **classes, derived classes, inlining, and default arguments** and in **1982** Stroustrup started to develop a successor to the **C with Classes**, which he named **C++**, to add more features like **virtual functions, function and operator overloading, and references,** and the developing still working until this moment.

| Year   | Language |
|-----------|:-----------------|
| 1969 | B |
| 1971 | New B |
| 1973 | NB renamed to C|
| 1978 | K&R  C |
| 1979 | C with Classes |
| 1982 | C++ |

We will see the development of the features for Cpp during the next topics.

## C++ standards
Since releasing **C++** in **1982** as an extension of **C** language it started to enhance to be a safer language to use rather than the **C** language, and during this journey, it has been officially released multiple times, these releases were called **Standardisation**. These standard versions start officially in **1998** after that in **2003** as **C++03**, then in **2011** as **C++11**, then in **2014** as **C++14** , then in **2017** as **C++17**, then in **2020** as **C++20**, then in **2023** as **C++23**, with a constant standard **every 3 years**.

## The Classic C++
So we can consider any release for C++ before C++11 in 2011 to be called the **Classic C++** because it was a small change from the C language itself, and from c++11 it is called **modern c++** and during our learning journey, we will know why and when more features were added to C++ language and released in every C++ standard.

## Why Use C++
C++ is widely used in todayâ€™s **embedded systems, browsers, graphical user interfaces, music players, video games, operating systems, compilers, system drivers, databases, and cloud computing**, it supports **object-oriented programming** which lowers the development cost by giving a clear structure to the program and allowing the reusability of code, and Its syntax is close to **C#** and **Java** so it is easy for the programmer to switch between these languages, plus It is efficient and close to machine programming.

## Who is using C++
Many popular systems use C++ for implementing the critical part of their system like **Google** in the Google Chromium browser and Google file system, **Microsoft** in most parts of Microsoft Windows, **Adobe** in Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Premier.
