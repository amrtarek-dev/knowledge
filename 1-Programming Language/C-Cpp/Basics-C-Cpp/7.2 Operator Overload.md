## Operator Overload (C++ only)
In C++, operator overloading allows you to redefine or "overload" most of the built-in operators to work with user-defined data types (like classes and structs).
To overload an operator, you define a function with a special name that includes the keyword `operator` followed by the symbol for the operator you want to overload. This function can be a member function of a class or a non-member function.

### Operators that can be overloaded
Almost all C++ operators can be overloaded, with a few exceptions. The operators that can be overloaded include:

- **Arithmetic operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **Relational operators:** `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- **Logical operators:** `&&`, `||`, `!`
- **Bitwise operators:** `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`
- **Assignment operators:** `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `<<=`, `>>=`
- **Unary operators:** `++`, `--`, `-`, `+`, `*`, `&`
- **Subscript operator:** `[]`
- **Function call operator:** `()`
- **Member access operators:** `->`, `.*`, `->*`
- **Comma operator:** `,`
- **Dereference operator:** `*`
- **Address-of operator:** `&`
- **New and delete operators:** `new`, `delete`, `new[]`, `delete[]`
- **Type cast operators:** `typeid`, `dynamic_cast`, `const_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`, `static_cast`

### Operators that can not overloaded
There are a few operators in C++ that you cannot overload:

- **Scope resolution operator:** `::`
- **Member access operator:** `.`
- **Member pointer access operator:** `.*`
- **Conditional (ternary) operator:** `?:`
- **Sizeof operator:** `sizeof`
- **Typeid operator:** `typeid`
- **Alignof operator:** `alignof`
- **Noexcept operator:** `noexcept`

``` cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define a struct to represent a point in 2D space
struct Point {
    int x, y;
};

// Overload the + operator for the Point struct
Point operator + (const Point& p1, const Point& p2) {
    Point result;
    result.x = p1.x + p2.x;
    result.y = p1.y + p2.y;
    return result;
}

// Function to display the coordinates of a point
void display(const Point& p) {
    std::cout << "(" << p.x << ", " << p.y << ")" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    Point p1 = {3, 4};  // Initialize point p1
    Point p2 = {1, 2};  // Initialize point p2

    Point p3 = p1 + p2;  // Use the overloaded + operator

    std::cout << "p1 + p2 = ";
    display(p3);  // Output: (4, 6)

    return 0;
}

```

> Guidelines for Operator Overloading
> 1.  **Maintain Intuition:** The overloaded operator should behave in a way that is intuitive and natural to users of your class. Overloading `+` for a class should likely result in a meaningful addition, just as it does for built-in types.
> 2. **Consistency:** If you overload one operator, consider if it makes sense to overload related operators as well (e.g., if you overload `==`, consider also overloading `!=`). 
> 3. **Return Values:** For operators like `=`, `+=`, or `-=`, return `*this` to allow chaining of operations.
> 4. **Avoid Overloading Operators that Might Confuse Users:** Some operators, like the comma operator `,`, might not always be suitable for overloading due to their subtle behavior.
