# Standards

Many individuals and organizations have contributed to create and set the standard (GSMA), it covers the entire network and endpoint systems.
It brings a structural approach with security controls on place.
it provides a demarcation based on its uses for enterprise to build id products.
This standard has 85 detailed recommendations and a structural approach that can fit into any IoT ecosystem.
It has a flexible framework addressing the diversity of the technology aligned to the regulation.
It also has a risk modeling capabilities for any organization to choose from including endpoint ecosystems.
The standard is very flexible and comes with the inbuilt risk assessments for any organization to adapt.

- Commonly used vocabulary
- Reusable designs
- Best practices for any developer to design an application
- Many secure application standards
