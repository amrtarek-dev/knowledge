Let's try to understand the various communication protocols available to setup IoT.
- Satellite
- WiFi
- Radio Frequency (RF)
- RFID
- Bluetooth
- NFC

## Satellite
This enables the cell phone communication through an antenna situated within 10 to 15 miles, they have a stable and universal connection 

## WiFi
It is base on five gigahertz frequencies, it provides internet access within a certain range and are an affordable option. it has well protected protocols

## Radio Frequency (RF)
It is the easiest form of communication, a few examples are ZigBee and Z-Wave which use low power RF radio, it consumes low energy which is a big advantage.
it is relatively simple to configure.

## RFID
It uses wireless electromagnetic fields to identify sensors and objects, and it is not require power.

## Bluetooth
It is useful for short term and short distance data exchange, and it is present in every smart phone and has sensors.

## NFC
The Near Field Communication uses electromagnetic induction and loop antennas, it comes with encryption, has low speed communication and it is used for short range data exchange.
