**RxJava** is a powerful library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using **observable sequences** in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
It’s part of the larger **ReactiveX** (Reactive Extensions) family, which provides a framework for handling asynchronous data streams, errors, and event-driven systems.

RxJava makes it easier to:
1. **Manage Asynchronous Data Streams**: Handle complex asynchronous workflows with a clear structure, which is especially useful for handling real-time updates, user actions, and network responses.
2. **Simplify Background Tasks**: RxJava’s operators make it easy to perform tasks in the background while keeping your main (UI) thread free and responsive.
3. **Error Handling**: The reactive programming model centralizes error handling, which can simplify debugging and make applications more robust.
4. **Reduce Boilerplate Code**: RxJava’s functional, declarative syntax allows developers to write concise, readable code, minimizing boilerplate around callbacks, threading, and error handling.
## Core Concepts

### ### **Observable**
An **Observable** is a data source that emits items (values, events, or signals) over time. It could represent anything that changes or happens asynchronously, like a network response, sensor data, or user interactions.
Observables emit items to **observers** (subscribers) that listen to these emissions and react accordingly.
An Observable in RxJava emits three types of events:
1. **Next** (`onNext`): When the observable emits an item, the observer receives it.
2. **Error** (`onError`): If something goes wrong, the observable notifies the observer of the error.
3. **Complete** (`onComplete`): The observable notifies the observer that there are no more items to emit.

### **Observer**
An **Observer** is an entity that subscribes to an Observable to receive and handle the emitted items. The observer defines how to process each item, handle errors, and respond to the completion of the observable sequence.
An **Observer** (or subscriber) listens to the observable and reacts to each event. Observers are defined by three main methods:
- `onNext(item)`: Called whenever the observable emits a new item.
- `onError(error)`: Called if an error occurs.
- `onComplete()`: Called when the observable completes, signaling that no more items will be emitted.

``` kotlin
val numberObservable = Observable.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

numberObservable
    .subscribe(
        { number -> println("Received: $number") },   // onNext: Handles each emitted item
        { error -> println("Error: $error") },        // onError: Handles errors
        { println("Completed") }                      // onComplete: Called when the observable completes
    )
```

``` bash
Received: 1
Received: 2
Received: 3
Received: 4
Received: 5
Completed
```

In this example:
- **`onNext` (`{ number -> ... }`)**: Called for each item the observable emits (here, numbers 1 through 5).
- **`onError` (`{ error -> ... }`)**: Called if an error occurs in the observable stream.
- **`onComplete` (`{ ... }`)**: Called when the observable completes its emissions.

#### Using Lambdas
When you only need to handle the emitted items, you can simplify `subscribe` by passing a single lambda (as in your code example):
``` kotlin
.subscribe { connectionEstablished -> 
    // React to each emitted value of 'connectionEstablished'
}
```
Here, `connectionEstablished` represents each item emitted by `onConnectionEstablished()`, likely a `Boolean` indicating the connection status.
### **Operators**
Operators are methods that transform, combine, filter, and manage the data emitted by an Observable. Examples include `map`, `filter`, `flatMap`, and `zip`, which allow for powerful data manipulation in a single reactive stream.

### **Schedulers**
Schedulers determine which thread an Observable will operate on.
RxJava provides **Schedulers** such as `Schedulers.io()` for I/O operations, `Schedulers.computation()` for CPU-bound tasks, and `AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()` for UI updates in Android. 
This flexibility allows developers to control the threading of asynchronous tasks and efficiently manage resources.

### **Disposable**
A **Disposable** is a reference to a subscription, allowing the observer to unsubscribe from the Observable when it’s no longer needed.
This is important in Android to avoid **memory leaks** by ensuring subscriptions are properly disposed of when an `Activity` or `Fragment` is destroyed.
