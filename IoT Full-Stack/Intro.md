**IoT Full-Stack** leverages your firmware background while expanding into cloud, web, and mobile. It makes you a hybrid engineer who can build the entire systemâ€”from device to dashboard.

Stack:
- **Firmware & Embedded**: C/C++, ESP32, STM32, FreeRTOS
- **Protocols**: MQTT, CoAP, BLE, Wi-Fi, LoRa
- **Backend**: Node.js or Python (REST APIs, WebSockets, MQTT brokers)
- **Frontend**: Flutter Web or React or Grafana
- **Database**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or InfluxDB
- **Mobile**: Flutter with Bluetooth/Wi-Fi integration
- **Edge/Cloud**: Raspberry Pi, Docker, VPS, or private cloud

## IoT Architect
- Designs end-to-end systems: device â†’ network â†’ backend â†’ UI
- Defines communication protocols (e.g., MQTT, HTTP, BLE)
- Chooses hardware platforms (e.g., ESP32, STM32)
- Plans scalable backend infrastructure (e.g., Docker, databases, cloud)
- Designs dashboards, APIs, mobile integration
- Implements OTA, device provisioning, and security models
- Collaborates with firmware, cloud, mobile, and product teams

### **Learn Architecture Design**
Study:
- **System design principles** (scalability, reliability, fault tolerance)
- **Security**: TLS, JWT, key provisioning, OTA best practices
- **IoT Reference Architectures**: AWS IoT Core, Azure IoT, Eclipse IoT
- **Design Patterns**: Pub/Sub, Microservices, CQRS, Edge Computing

Books:
- _Designing Connected Products_ by Claire Rowland
- _Software Architecture Patterns_ by Mark Richards (free on Oâ€™Reilly)
- _Designing Distributed Systems_ by Brendan Burns (from Microsoft)

### **Develop Leadership + Communication**
Architects must:
- Communicate trade-offs to teams and management
- Write tech specs and diagrams
- Lead decisions on tools, protocols, timelines

Practice using tools like:
- Draw.io or Miro for diagrams
- Markdown/Notion for documentation
- Present your designs in meetups or on your blog
