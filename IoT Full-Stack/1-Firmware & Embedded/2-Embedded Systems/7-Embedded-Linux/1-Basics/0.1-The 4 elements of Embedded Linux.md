A typical Embedded System Linux-based is made of multiple components:

``` mermaid
block-beta
 columns 2
 block:RootFileSystem:2
  columns 1
  a["Application"]
  SP["System Programs"]
 end

 block:LinuxKernel:2
  columns 2
   SCI["System Call \n Interface"]:2
   PM["Process \n Management"] VFS["Virtual File \n System"]
   MM["Memory \n Management"] NM["Network \n Management"]
   DD["Device Drivers"]:2
 end

Bootloader DT["Device Tree"]

Hardware:2
```

Every embedded linux project target is obtaining, customising and deploying these four elements:
- Toolchain
- Bootloader
	- Device tree
- Kernel
- Root filesystem

## Toolchain
This consists of the compiler and other tools needed to create code for your target device, every thing else depends on the toolchain.
## Bootloader
it is a software executed at power-up to set-up the hardware to run the operating system

### Device tree
It is a data tree structure with nodes that describe the physical devices in the hardware needed by the Linux Kernel to initialize properly the device drivers.

## Linux Kernel
The Operating System code providing all the services to manage the hardware resource and many other tasks.

## Root File System
It is a container for the Linux Kernel configuration files, the system programs and the Application.

### System Programs:
It is a part of the Root file system which is user-friendly utilities to access operating system services.

### Application
It is a part of the Root file system which is a software implementing the functionalities to be delivered to the embedded system user.
