Computer Architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe **the functionality, organization, and implementation** of computer systems.

It is mainly concerned with the interactions between CPU, memory and I/O devices.

### Von Neumann Architecture
- **Shared memory space** for instructions and data.
- **Single bus system** leads to a bottleneck (Von Neumann Bottleneck).
- **Cheaper and simpler design**.

> Most general-purpose microprocessors use Von Neumann.

It is one of the famous computer architectures.
- Only one memory holds data and program
> Von Neumann bottleneck:
> 	- Instructions can only be done one at a time and can only be carried out sequentially, which will make enhancing performance is very hard.


### Harvard Architecture
- **Separate memory** for instructions and data.
- **Parallel access paths** enable faster performance.
- **Common in Microcontrollers** and DSPs for real-time processing.

> Many MCUs like AVR, PIC, and some ARM Cortex-M implement Harvard or modified Harvard architectures.

It is the computer architecture that contains **separate storage and separate buses** for instructions and data.
it is mainly developed to **overcome VonNeumann** bottleneck.
The main advantage that the CPU can access instructions and read/write data at the same time.
