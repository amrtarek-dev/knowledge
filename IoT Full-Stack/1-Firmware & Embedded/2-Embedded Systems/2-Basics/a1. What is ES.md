# What is the Embedded System and how to start with it?
Embedded Systems are computer systems that are built into devices that perform a specific function. They are found in a wide variety of applications, from cars to medical devices to consumer electronics. 

Learning how to design and develop embedded systems can open up a world of opportunities in the field of engineering.
## Start with Embedded System
Embedded systems are computer systems that are typically found in products like automobiles, medical equipment, home appliances, and industrial control systems. They are designed to carry out specific tasks, frequently under real-time constraints. Here are some of the key subjects with accompanying examples that one can learn to master embedded systems:

- ### Computer architecture
To learn embedded systems, it's essential to have a good understanding of computer architecture. This includes **processors, memory, input/output devices, and basic programming concepts**. Start by learning about the different types of processors and their architecture. Learn about memory, including RAM and ROM, and how to interface with it. Finally, learn about input/output devices, including how to read and write data from sensors and actuators.

- ### Electronics
Get a good understanding of electronics concepts, including digital, analogue electronics, and circuit design, because Embedded systems often have specific hardware requirements and constraints, such as limited power, memory, and processing capabilities. You should understand how to design and implement hardware components and how to interface with them in your software. Learn about circuit design, schematic capture, and PCB layout. Learn how to design and implement sensors, actuators, and other hardware components.

- ### Hardware and Interfacing
Many times, embedded systems have particular hardware specifications and limitations, such as constrained power, memory, and processing capabilities. You should be familiar with how to **create and use hardware components**, as well as how to interface with them in your **software**. The heart of the majority of embedded systems is a **microcontroller**. Start by learning about the various types of microcontrollers that are available, their architecture, and how to program them. Embedded systems frequently need to interact with other systems via wired or wireless connections. Discover more about protocols for communication like **Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, SPI, UART, and more**.

- ### Programming Language
Programming for embedded systems is done in specialized languages like **C/C++ and Assembly**. Learn the fundamentals of C programming at first, paying particular attention to data types, control structures, functions, pointers, and arrays. Understanding the syntax and grammatical structure of the language is crucial. You can advance to more complex subjects like interrupts, memory management, and optimization strategies once you have a solid foundation in C programming.

- ### Development Tools and testing
Learn about the various embedded system development tools, such as compilers, debuggers, and integrated development environments (IDEs), and how to use them to debug and test your system. This is important because testing and debugging are essential to the design of embedded systems to ensure that they perform as intended. Embedded system testing and debugging methods include JTAG and boundary scan.

- ### Development Types
Depending on the specific needs of the embedded system, the preferences and the level of expertise of the development team, there are various types of embedded software development. For example, **bare-metal** programming is a programming approach in which the software code is written to run directly on the hardware without an underlying operating system or programming that is based on an **operating system**, such as Linux or RTOS, which supports multitasking, and task prioritisation, and offers a range of services like task scheduling, inter-task communication, and synchronisation, making it possible for developers to create intricate applications with real-time demands.


## What are the positions in embedded systems?
There are many positions available in the field of embedded systems, and they range from entry-level to advanced positions. Some of the most common positions in the field of embedded systems include:

- ### Embedded software engineer
An embedded software engineer is responsible for developing software that is specifically designed for embedded systems. They work with microcontrollers, sensors, and other hardware components to create software that is optimized for performance and power consumption. They also write code in programming languages like C, C++, and Assembly.

- ### Embedded hardware engineer
An embedded hardware engineer is responsible for designing and developing hardware components for embedded systems. They work with microcontrollers, sensors, and other electronic components to create hardware that is optimized for performance and power consumption. They also design and implement schematics and printed circuit boards (PCBs) for the hardware components.

- ### Embedded Firmware engineer
A firmware engineer is responsible for developing low-level software that operates within the hardware of embedded systems. They work closely with hardware engineers to ensure that the firmware is optimized for the specific hardware platform. They also write code in programming languages like C and Assembly.

- ### Embedded systems architect
An embedded systems architect is responsible for designing and developing the architecture of embedded systems. They work with hardware and software engineers to ensure that the system architecture is optimised for performance, power consumption, and cost. They also ensure that the system meets the specific requirements of the application.

- ### Embedded systems designer
An embedded systems designer is responsible for designing and developing complete embedded systems, including both hardware and software components. They work closely with engineers from multiple disciplines to ensure that the system meets the specific requirements of the application. They also ensure that the system is optimised for performance, power consumption, and cost.

- ### Quality assurance engineer
A quality assurance engineer is responsible for testing embedded systems to ensure that they meet the specific requirements of the application. They work closely with hardware and software engineers to develop test plans and to ensure that the system is performing as expected.

- ### Technical support engineer
A technical support engineer is responsible for providing technical support for embedded systems. They work closely with customers to troubleshoot issues and to provide guidance on how to use the system effectively.

There are also many other positions available in the field of embedded systems, including project managers, system integrators, and test engineers. As the field of embedded systems continues to evolve, new positions will likely emerge.
