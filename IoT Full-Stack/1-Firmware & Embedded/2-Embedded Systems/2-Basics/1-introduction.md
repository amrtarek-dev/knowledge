# What is the Embedded Systems

Embedded Systems are hardware controlled by software to perform specific and periodic functionality.
Like the Network router which is responsible only to orgonize and routing your network, or the ATM machine which is responsible only for dealing with money withdrawals or deposits.

It may be a real-time or super loop. Real-time means it needs to meet a deadline to be functional and successful, like the Airbag system. and it is using a real-time operating system to handle these critical needs.

## What are the main components of any embedded system?
- Hardware
	- Microcontroller
	- or System on Chip (SoC)
- Interfaces to act with the external world (input and output devices)
    - Input and output devices like LCD, LED, siren, buttons, sensors, motors, etc.
- Software to control this hardware.
	- Super loop software for a Microcontroller.
	- Operating System for SoC.

## Embedded Systems Characteristics
Embedded systems has to be:
- Single-Functioned: which making a repeated single functionality.
- Tightly Constrained: It has to be small size with known speed, and low power consumption.
- Reactive and Real time: reacts to change in system environment.
- Microprocessor Based: no embedded system without a microprocessor or microcontroller.
- Memory: its memory is limited in size.
- Connected: it must be connected to input and output devices.

## Advantages and Disadvantages
A system with previous characteristics has an advantage and disadvantages like:

- Advantages:
	- Easily Customisable
	- Low power consumption
	- Low cost
	- Enhanced performance
- Disadvantages:
	- High development effort
	- Limited resources, memory, processing speed.

## Applications
Embedded systems is already used in multiple applications like:
- Automotive: Cruise control, light control, ABS, EBD, ESP, ... etc.
- Networking: Routers, and switches.
- Fintech: ATM, Point Of Sale, Vending machines, ... etc.
- Home appliances: Home Automation, Air conditioners, microwave ovens, washing machines and dishwashers, ... etc.
- Biomedical: Wearable devices, Tele-radiology, ... etc.
- Military: Missile targeting systems, command-and-control systems, electronics warfare, ... etc.
- Consumer Electronics: MP3 players, television sets, mobile phones, video game console, digital cameras, GPS receivers, printers, ... etc.
