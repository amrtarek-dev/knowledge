# Fundamental of Electricity
To understand the electricity we need to understand the **electrical charge**, because electricity is simply the movement and accumulation of electrically charge particles.

If you've ever been shocked when you touch a doorknob after shuffling across the carpet on a dry day, then you've felt the effect of electrical charge.

When we rubbed certain objects together, it would cause those objects to either attract or repel each other. For example, when we rub a balloon on a wool scarf, they become attracted to each other and they stick together.

This happens because the friction creates an imbalance of electrical charge between those objects. 

## Atoms
All objects are made of tiny little building blocks called **atoms**, which are way too small to see. And each of those atoms consist of **three** types of even tinier little particles called **protons**, **neutrons**, and **electrons**. 

**Protons** and **electrons** are particles which have equal and opposite and electrical charges.
**Protons** are **positively Charged** and the **electrons** are **negatively charged**.

The **Neutrons** don't have any electrical charge, so we call them **neutral** 

## Coulombs
The **amount of charge** in an object can be measured using an unit called coulombs (C). **One Coulomb** is equivalent to a certain number of positively charged protons, and negative one coulomb is equal to the same number of negatively charged electrons.
```md
1 coulomb = 6.242 x 10^18 protons
-1 coulomb = 6.242 x 10^18 electrons
```

## Nucleus
The proton and neutron particles are clumped together at the center of each atom in what is called nucleus, and electrons have a lot more freedom to move around.
