	- ARM originated from a company called **Acorn Computers** in the 1980s.
	- The first ARM processor, **ARM1**, was released in 1985, primarily designed for Acorn’s personal computers.
	- It followed the RISC principles established at the University of California, Berkeley, emphasizing simplicity and efficiency.
2. **Commercial Success**:
	- In 1990, ARM Ltd. was established as an independent entity, leading to its widespread adoption.
	- Early success came with the **Apple Newton PDA**, one of the first mobile devices powered by ARM.
3. **Evolution Through Versions**:
	- **ARMv1 to ARMv3**: Initial implementations focusing on basic RISC principles.
	- **ARMv4 to ARMv6**: Introduction of features like Thumb instruction set for compact code, 16-bit instructions.
	- **ARMv7**: Brought Cortex family (A, R, M series), supporting a broader range of devices.
	- **ARMv8**: Introduced 64-bit architecture (AArch64), enabling ARM’s entry into high-performance computing and servers.
	- **ARMv9**: Focuses on enhanced security (TrustZone), machine learning (ML), and performance improvements.
4. **Modern ARM**:
	- ARM designs are widely licensed to semiconductor companies like Qualcomm, NVIDIA, and Apple, powering CPUs, GPUs, and SoCs in devices from smartphones to servers.
	- ARM processors are embedded in over **95% of the world’s smartphones** and increasingly in laptops, IoT devices, and data centers.
1. **Why Choose ARM?**
	- Key advantages: low power, scalability, and ecosystem.
	- Application domains: IoT, automotive, industrial, and consumer electronics.
