# Flow Control
Normal code is executed from top to bottom, starting from the main function, Flow control in C and C++ refers to the mechanisms that control the sequence in which statements are executed in a program. This includes decisions, loops, and jumps, allowing the program to behave differently based on conditions or to repeat certain actions.

To change the flow you can use a number of keywords:
- if, else
- Ternary
- Switch
- while, do-while
- For
- Range-based
- Try, catch, and throw
- Jump Statements

these keywords work with logical expressions:
- (x > 0)
- (y-2 < b)

and you have to use parentheses to format the condition. 
### If-else

``` cpp
int x = 7;
if (x > 10) {
    printf("x is greater than 10\n");
} else if (x > 5) {
    printf("x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10\n");
} else {
    printf("x is 5 or less\n");
}

```
### Ternary
It is a concise way to perform a simple `if-else` statement. It is available in both C and C++, but it's often used more frequently in C++ due to the language's emphasis on concise and expressive code.
``` cpp
// condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;
int a = 10;
int b = 20; 
// Using ternary operator 
int max = (a > b) ? a : b;

int z = 15; 
// Finding the maximum value using nested ternary operators 
int max = (x > y) ? ((x > z) ? x : z) : ((y > z) ? y : z);
```
### switch case

``` cpp
int in = 0;

switch(in) {
	case 0: 
		printf("Zero");
		break;
	case 1:
		printf("One");
		break;
	default:
		print("unknow");
} 
```

### while loop
It is repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.
``` cpp
while(keepgoing)
{
    // ...
    break;
    continue;
    if (answer == 0)
    {
        keepgoing = false;
    }
}
```
### do-while
Similar to `while`, but the condition is checked after the loop's body is executed, ensuring the loop runs at least once.
``` cpp
int i = 0;
do { 
	printf("i = %d\n", i);
	i++;
} while (i < 5);
```
### for loop
Traditional for loop has three parts:
- initialiser
- continue condition
- incremented

```cpp
for (int loop = 0; loop < 10; loop++ )
{
    // ...
}
```

### for range (C++11)
```cpp
int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
for (int x : arr)
{
    cout << x ; // will print 1234
}
```

### Jump Statements
Jump statements allow the program to abruptly change the flow of execution.

#### `break` statement
Exits a loop or `switch` statement prematurely.
``` cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
        break;
    }
    printf("i = %d\n", i);
}
```

#### `continue` statement  
Skips the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration.
``` cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 2) {
        continue;
    }
    printf("i = %d\n", i);
}
```

#### `goto` statement
Jumps to a labeled statement. Its use is generally discouraged as it can lead to unstructured and hard-to-read code.
``` cpp
int x = 5;
if (x == 5) {
    goto label;
}
printf("This won't be printed if x is 5\n");
label:
printf("Jumped to label\n");
```

### `try` , `catch`, and `throw` (C++ only)
C++ provides a structured way to handle errors and exceptions using `try`, `catch`, and `throw` blocks.
``` cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

int main() {
    try {
        int x = -1;
        if (x < 0) {
            throw std::invalid_argument("Negative value not allowed");
        }
        std::cout << "Value of x: " << x << std::endl;
    } catch (const std::exception &e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
#### `return` statement
Exits a function and optionally returns a value.
``` cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
