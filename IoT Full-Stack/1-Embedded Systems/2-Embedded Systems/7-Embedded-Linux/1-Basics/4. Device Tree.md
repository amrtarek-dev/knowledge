To manage hardware resources, the kernel need to know which resources are available in the embedded system (i.e the hardware description: I/O devices, memory, etc).

There are two ways to provide this information to the kernel:
1. **Hardcode it** into the kernel binary code.
		Each modification to the hardware definition requires recompiling the source code.
2. Providing it to the kernel when the bootloader uses a binary file (the device tree blob),

## Device Tree Blob (DTB)
A device tree blob (DTB) file is produced from a device tree source (DTS),
A hardware definition can be changed more easily as only DTS recompilation is needed.
Kernel recompilation is not needed upon changes to the hardware definition. (This is a big time saver).
