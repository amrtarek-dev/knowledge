**KAS** (Kick-Ass Setup) is a build tool that simplifies the management of Yocto Project configurations. By leveraging a YAML-based configuration system, KAS allows developers to define repositories, layers, and build settings in a structured and reusable format.

## Why KAS
1. **Centralized Configuration**:
    - KAS uses a single YAML file to define all required layers, repositories, and settings, ensuring clarity and reducing setup time.
2. **Multi-repository Support**:
    - It manages layers from different Git repositories, making it easy to work with modular projects.
3. **Reproducibility**:
    - By specifying exact branches, commits, and versions in the YAML file, KAS ensures that builds are consistent across different environments.
4. **Containerized Builds**:
    - KAS integrates with Docker, enabling developers to perform builds in isolated, containerized environments.
5. **Simplified Workflow**:
    - Reduces the manual effort required to set up and manage Yocto builds, allowing teams to focus on development rather than configuration.

## KAS YAML files
KAS uses YAML files to define:
- **Repositories**: URLs, branches, and commit hashes for each layer.
- **Dependencies**: Relationships between layers.
- **Build Settings**: Environment variables, build directories, and more.

``` yaml
header:
  version: 1
repos:
  poky:
    url: https://git.yoctoproject.org/git/poky
    refspec: kirkstone
  meta-openembedded:
    url: https://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded
    refspec: kirkstone
  meta-layer:
    url: https://github.com/example/meta-layer
    refspec: master
build_system:
  env: poky
```

## Use KAS
### **Install KAS**
KAS can be installed using pip:
``` bash
pip install kas
```
or on debian linux 
``` bash
sudo apt install kas
```
### Run a b Build**
To fetch repositories and start the build
``` bash
kas build file-name.yml
```

### **Use Docker**
To run the build in a Docker container
``` bash
kas-container build file-name.yml
```

## build a recipe
``` bash
kas shell ../kas-rb3.yml -- bitbake python3-webrtc-noise-gain
```
