An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules designed to perform a task or solve a problem.

Algorithms are used in software engineering to automate tasks, manipulate data, perform calculations, and process input to produce desired output.

## Types of Algorithms:
### Sorting Algorithms:
Algorithms for arranging elements in a particular order.
- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort.
### Searching Algorithms:
Algorithms used to find specific data within a data structure.
- Binary Search
- Linear Search
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS).
### Graph Algorithms:
Algorithms for processing graph data structures (nodes and edges).
- Dijkstra's Algorithm (shortest path)
- Kruskal's Algorithm (minimum spanning tree).

### Dynamic Programming Algorithms: 
Solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the solutions to avoid redundant computations.
- Fibonacci sequence calculation
- Knapsack problem.

### Greedy Algorithms:
Make locally optimal choices at each step to find a global solution.
- Prim's Algorithm (for minimum spanning trees)
- Huffman Coding.
