A **data structure** is a way of organizing, storing, and managing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

Different data structures are suited for different kinds of tasks.

## Arrays
A collection of elements, identified by index or key.

## Linked Lists:
A collection of elements where each element points to the next, forming a chain.
- **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both the next and previous nodes.

## Stacks
A data structure where elements follow a Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

## Queues
A First In First Out (FIFO) data structure.

## Hash Tables
A data structure that stores data in an associative manner, where a key is mapped to a value.

## Trees
A hierarchical data structure made up of nodes, where each node has a value and children nodes.
- **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree with a special condition that left children are smaller than the node, and right children are larger.
- **Heaps**: A special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property (either max-heap or min-heap).
- **Graphs**: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Can be directed or undirected.
