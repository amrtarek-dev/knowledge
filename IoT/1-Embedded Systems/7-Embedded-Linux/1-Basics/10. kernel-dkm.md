## Linux Kernel
The Linux kernel is the lowest level software, that sits between hardware and programs/apps, and it controls each aspect of the computer operation.

### Monolithic
Linux uses monolithic kernels, which is the opposite of the microkernel, this means that as well as it is containing the CPU and memory management they also hold file management systems, device drivers, and other key parts to the computer.

## Device driver
A device driver is software that handles communication between the hardware and the computer operating system or kernel.

CPUs and I/O devices are operating synchronously, device drivers prude this gap using either a parallel or series system.

### Parallel system
It sends one word or more per operation across multiple lines.

### Serial system
It sends one bit per operation across a few lines.

## DKM with yocto
DKM is a Dynamic kernel module, which the kernel used to interact with the hardware, we are going to continue on the [Start Yocto](blog/embedded/embedded-linux/yocto) practice, which assume right now that you have a full yocto build environment for raspberrypi3.

### hello.c
First we need to make the loadable kerenl module file which will just print hello world by this way:
```c
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/init.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/types.h>
#include <linux/kdev.h>
#include <linux/fs.h>
#include <linux/cdev.h>
#include <asm/uaccess.h>

static dev_t hello_dev;

struct cdev hello_cdev;

static char buffer[64];
 ssize_t hello_read(struct file *filp, char __user *bug, size_t count, loff_t *f_pos)
 {
         printk(KERN_INFO "Helloworld read (count=%d, offset=%d)\n", (int)count, (int)*f_pos );
         
         return 1;
 }

 struct file_operations hello_fops = {
         .owner = THIS_MODULE,
         .read = hello_read,
 };

static int __init hello_module_init(void)
{
        printk(KERN_INFO "Loading Helloworld_module.\n");

        alloc_chrdev_region(&hello_dev, 0, 1, "hello_dev");
        printk(KERN_INFO "%s\n, format_dev_t(buffer, hello_dev));

        cdev_init(&hello_cdev, &hello_fops);
        hello_cdev.owner = THIS_MODULE;
        cdev_add(&hello_cdev, hello_dev, 1);

        return 0;
}
static void __exit hello module_cleanup(void)
{
        printk(KERN_INFO "Cleaning-up hello_dev.\n");
        cdev_del(&hello_cdev);
        unregister_chrdev_region(hello_dev, 1);
}

module_init(hello_module_init);
module_exit(hello_module_cleanup);
MODULE_AUTHOR("Amr Abdelghafar");
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
```
make this file called "**hello.c**" and put it in folder called "**files**", 
with this **Makefile**

```bash

```
then make the bitbake file 

### Hello-mod.bb
Then we need to add the recipe kernel file to our build so make a new file called "**hello_1.0.bb**" by this way:

```bash
DESCRIPTION = "hello driver"
LICENSE = "GPLv2+"
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://${BPN}.;endline=19;md5=4866f9824d27c1cd5324fd5e84caeb6e"

inherit module

PR = "r0"

SRC_URI = "file://Makefile file://${BPN}.c"
S = "${WORKDIR}"
```
and then put all of this in the yocto build system by this way:

```bash
cd ~/poky/sources
mkdir -p meta-raspberrypi/recipes-kerenl/hello-mod
touch hello_1.0.bb
```

### local.conf
At the end edit the local.conf file to have the new module by appending the file with this line:
```bash
IMAGE_INSTALL_append += "hello"
```

### clean
Before making a new image it is recommended to clean the previous one by running this command:

```bash
bitbake -c clean rpi-basic-image
```

### Build
Now you are ready to build again
```bash
bitbake rpi-basic-image
```

if you faced an error with "LIC__FILES_CHKSUM does not match" take the new md5 checksum and replace it in the **hello_1.0.bb**
