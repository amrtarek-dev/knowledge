@Understand how the Embedded system C program is compiling and executing.
## Compilation process
- Preprocessor
- Compiler
- Assembler
- Linker
- Locator
- Executable

### Preprocessor
It is the first phase which takes the C files *.c and replace the preprocessor directives (#include, #define, etc..) to its real values, and out another C files *.c

### Compilation
It is the phase which takes C and assemble files *.c, *.asm and produce the object files *.o

### Linker
It is the phase which takes the object files and link it together wiht the libraries.
- Static linking: means adding the library file to the executable
- Dynamic linking: means adding a path reference to use the library to the executable.

### Locator
Locator using a **linker script file** to locate every code segment to memory to generate the executable. 
- ".text": program code
- ".data": initialized data
- ".bss": unintialized data.
- ".isr_vectors: interrupt table"

## The binary image
Everything that we write in our code compiles into container called binary image. 
One format of binary image is **Executable and linkable file format (ELF) which is used by most linux based systems today to store compiled program image.
