Memories in computer are electronics components that stores data and program instructions.

## Register
It is the fastest memory component, it reads and write in 1 CPU cycle because it is on the CPU, volatile memory.
Registers are **used directly by the CPU** while executing instructions, because it is inside the CPU.
Registers Examples:
- **Accumulator (ACC)** – stores arithmetic/logic results.
- **Program Counter (PC)** – keeps track of the next instruction.
- **Instruction Register (IR)** – holds the current instruction.
- **Memory Address Register (MAR)** – stores address to access memory.
- **Memory Data Register (MDR)** – holds data being transferred to/from memory.
- **General-purpose registers** – for temporary data in calculations.

## Caches
Its storage capacity is bigger than Register, but it is slower and it is on the CPU too, volatile memory.
It sits **between the CPU and RAM (main memory)**.
- It stores **frequently accessed data and instructions** so the CPU can retrieve them **faster** than going all the way to RAM.
- The idea is to **reduce the time** the CPU takes to get data from memory (called **memory access time**).

> Cache acts like a **buffer or middle layer**, giving the CPU the data it needs much faster.

## Main Memory (RAM)
Its storage capacity is bigger than Caches, but it is slower than Caches and it is not on the CPU, volatile memory.
Types:
- SRAM: Static RAM
	- It is larger (physical size), consume more power, and smaller in capacity than DRAM.
	- But it is faster
- DRAM: Dynamic RAM
	- it is smaller, and slower than SRAM.
	- But it has more capacity, consume less power.

## Flash Disk (ROM)
Its storage capacity is bigger than RAM but slower, and it is non-volatile
Types:
- MROM: Maskable ROM, and can not be programmed
- PROM: Programmable ROM, and can be programmed once.
- EPROM: Erasable PROM, it can be erased using UV and reprogrammed.
- EEPROM: Electrically EPROM, it can be electrically erase and reprogrammed.
- Flash: It is EEPROM with larger page size.

## Traditional Disk (HDD)
Its storage capacity is bigger than Flash disk but slower, and it is non-volatile.

## Remote Secondary Storage
Its storage capacity is bigger than Traditional disk, but slower, and depends on the network speed.
