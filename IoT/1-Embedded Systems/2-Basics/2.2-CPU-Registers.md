#### General Purpose Register (GPR)
They are available to store any transient data required by the program.
> In general the more registers a CPU has, the faster it can work.
#### Program Counter (PC)
It is the most important CPU register, which holds the **address of the next instruction** in program memory space.

The size of the program counter register is related to the size of the microcontroller program memory.

#### Instruction Register (IR)
It contains the next instruction (Op-Code) to be decoded by the Instruction Decoder

#### Instruction Decoder (ID)
It takes the Op-Code stored in the instruction register and decodes it then tells the CPU what to do for it and enable the components for this operation.

#### Status Register (SREG)
It contains flags represent the status of the last operation to control the following instructions:
- Overflow Flag: it means that the result is too large to fit in the register width.
- Negative flag: the result is negative
- Zero flag: the result is zero
- Carry flag: indicates a carry in the last arithmetic or logical operation.
- Half-carry flag: indicates that a bit carry was produced between the 4-bit halves of the byte operand as a result of the last arithmetic operation.
- Global Interrupt Mask: (Global interrupt status and enabler)

#### Accumulator Register (ACC)
It is a register where saves the intermediate arithmetic and logic results.
it is faster to save the result in this register rather than write it to main memory especially to use it in the next operation.
#### Stack Pointer (SP)
It is a register which holds the memory address of the last location on the stack where the data are stored, 
or the memory of the next available location on the stack to store data.
> It will point to next instruction in case of the POP call and to the next available location (Empty) after push call.

#### Index Registers (X, Y)
It is used in case of the indirect memory access mode.
> accessed address = index register + offset mentioned in the code


## Registers in x86 vs ARM Architectures
### **1. x86 Architecture (CISC – Complex Instruction Set Computer)**

#### **General-Purpose Registers (32-bit – x86):**

|Register|Usage|
|---|---|
|**EAX**|Accumulator (used in arithmetic/logic operations)|
|**EBX**|Base register (often used in memory addressing)|
|**ECX**|Counter register (used in loops and string operations)|
|**EDX**|Data register (used in I/O operations and math)|
|**ESI**|Source index (for memory string operations)|
|**EDI**|Destination index (for memory string operations)|
|**EBP**|Base pointer (used for stack frame reference)|
|**ESP**|Stack pointer (points to the top of the stack)|
|**EIP**|Instruction pointer (points to the next instruction)|
|**EFLAGS**|Status flags (e.g., zero, carry, overflow, etc.)|

> 📝 _In 64-bit x86 (x86-64 or AMD64), these become:_

- **RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX, RSI, RDI, RBP, RSP, RIP**
- Also includes **R8 to R15** for additional general-purpose registers.

---

### 🔸 **2. ARM Architecture (RISC – Reduced Instruction Set Computer)**

ARM registers are **uniform and general-purpose**, especially in **ARMv7 (32-bit)** and **ARMv8 (64-bit)**.

#### 📍 **ARM 32-bit (ARMv7-A or ARM Cortex-M):**

|Register|Usage|
|---|---|
|**R0–R12**|General-purpose registers|
|**R13 (SP)**|Stack Pointer|
|**R14 (LR)**|Link Register (stores return address on function call)|
|**R15 (PC)**|Program Counter (current instruction address)|
|**CPSR**|Current Program Status Register (flags, mode bits, etc.)|

> _Note:_ **R0–R3** are often used for function arguments and return values.

#### 📍 **ARM 64-bit (ARMv8-A / AArch64):**

|Register|Usage|
|---|---|
|**X0–X30**|64-bit general-purpose registers|
|**SP**|Stack Pointer|
|**PC**|Program Counter|
|**LR (X30)**|Link Register|
|**PSTATE**|Processor State Register (flags, execution state, etc.)|

- **W0–W30** are the **lower 32-bit aliases** of X0–X30.

> In AArch64, **X0–X7** are used for function arguments and return values, **X8** is a global pointer, and **X30** is the **Link Register**.

---

### ✅ **Comparison Summary:**

|Feature|**x86**|**ARM**|
|---|---|---|
|Register Naming|EAX, EBX, ECX, etc.|R0–R15 (32-bit), X0–X30 (64-bit)|
|Special Registers|EIP, ESP, EBP|PC, SP, LR|
|Register Count|Fewer (x86), more in x86-64|More general-purpose registers|
|Instruction Type|Complex|Simplified and uniform|
|Architecture|CISC|RISC|

### 💡 **Why This Matters in Embedded Systems:**

- In **bare-metal or low-level firmware**, you directly use these registers for:
    - Data storage
    - Function arguments
    - Stack and memory operations
- Understanding register usage improves **performance tuning**, **interrupt handling**, and **debugging**.
