- Hardware Multitasking (Parallelism)
- Software Multitasking (ConCurrency)


## Parallelism
it is true simultaneous execution on multiple CPUs/cores

## Concurrency
is the ability of a system to **run multiple tasks "at the same time"**


- **Cooperative concurrency** – Tasks yield control
- **Preemptive concurrency** – OS decides when to switch tasks

PreEmption
A higher priority task will interrupt a lower-priority task.
