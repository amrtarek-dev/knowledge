## KNX Association
- Started in 1990 with name EIB Association (EIBA) in Belguim (Brussels)
- in 1999 it has been merged with the European association 
	- BCI from France
	- European Home Systems Association (EHS) from Netherlands
- In 2006 it called KNX open standard for smart homes and buildings.

They defining the open standard KNX for integration, It is not open source, but it is a standard to make a common base communication.

**KNX** is an **international standard (ISO/IEC 14543)** for home and building automation. It enables various smart devices like lights, HVAC systems, blinds, alarms, sensors, and more to communicate and work together over a **common network** regardless of manufacturer.

**KNX** originally stood for the three systems it unified:
- **Konnex** (from German “Konnex”, meaning “connection”)
- **EIB** – _European Installation Bus_
- **BatiBUS** – A French building automation system
- **EHSA** – _European Home Systems Association_

When these systems merged in 1999, they formed **KNX**, and the name became a standalone brand—so today, **KNX doesn’t officially stand for anything** specific anymore.

### Features
- **Open Standard**: Vendor-independent, supported by 500+ manufacturers.
- **Decentralized**: Devices have their own intelligence and can operate autonomously.
- **Interoperable**: You can mix devices from different brands easily.
-  **Wired or Wireless**: Runs on twisted-pair (TP), Ethernet/IP, powerline, or even over USB.
	- wireless by KNX RF on 868 MHz 
	- KNX RF devices can be integrated with wired KNX TP system using media couplers.

- **Secure**: KNX Secure provides encryption for communication.
	- KNX RF Secure: provides encryption and authentication to prevent tampering or eavesdropping.

## How it works
- Devices are programmed using **ETS (Engineering Tool Software)**.
- Each device gets a **Group Address**, and devices listen/respond to telegrams (messages) on the bus.
- Scenes and logic can be programmed directly into devices without needing a central controller.
