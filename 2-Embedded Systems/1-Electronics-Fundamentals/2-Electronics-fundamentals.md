# Fundamentals of Electronics
The word electronics is derived from the word **electron**, which is the subatomic particle that has negative charge.
However, electronics has simplified the field theory into manageable models that can be used to create circuits that perform various functions.

There are two types of electronics:
- Analog Electronics
- Digital Electronics

## Analog Electronics
Analog electronics is the study of electrical systems that process smoothly varying electrical signals. like Audio wave, So Analog Systems is the basis of everything.

The building blocks of analog electronics are very few.
- Resistors: Resist current flow, drop voltages.
- Capacitors: Store electrical charge.
- Inductors/Coils: Store/transfer electromagnetic energy.
- Diodes: Allow current to flow in one direction only.
- Transistors: Used as amplifiers and switches.
- Batteries: Source of electrical current/voltage generators.
- Wires: used as conductors so that electrical current and signals can flow from one electrical element to another.

## Digital Electronics
Digital electronics are ultimately based on analog building blocks, but these building blocks have been encapsulated in chips and operate with only two states **HIGH** (ON) and **LOW** (OFF).
Hence each digital component is a black box as far as we are concerned. Only when designing interface or very high-speed systems do you really have to worry about the electrical characteristics of the chips.

Some examples of digital systems are:
- Computer
- Calculators
- LCD watches
- Video game consoles.

## ADC
ADC is an Analog to Digital converter which we use to conver the Analog signal to Digital Signal.

## Measuring Units
Th system that is most widely used in the world of electronics for measurment of units called **International System of Units** or the **SI** system, but we will use the **metric** system here.

| Quantity |   Name   | Symbol | Units |
|:--------:|:--------:|:------:|:-----:|
| Time     | Secound  | s      | -     |  
| Length   | Meter    | m      | -     |
| Mass     | Kilogram | kg     | -     |
| Force    | Newton   | N      | 1kg *m/s |
| Charge   | Coulomb  | C      | 6.24x10 16 electron|
| Energy   | Joule    | J      | 1 N*M |
| Current  | Ampere   | A      | 1 C/s |
| Voltage  | Volt     | V      | 1 J/C |
| Power    | Watt     | W      | 1 J/s |


## Current Types
- Electrical current: From + to - (the electrons follow)
- Conventional Current: from - to + (the holes follow)

## SemiConductors
The three main semiconductors matreial that is used in electronics are:
- Silicon  (4 Electron)
- Boron (N-Type dopant) (3 electron)
- Photphorous (N-Type dopant)  ( 5 electrons)

## dopant
There are 2 types of dopant:
- N-type
- P-type

To make a N-Type:
Adding Photporous (5 electrons) (more negative charge) + Silicon (4) (stable charge) = Negative Type

To make a P-Type:
Adding Boron (3 electrons) (more positive charge) + Silicon (4) (stable charrge) = Positive Type
