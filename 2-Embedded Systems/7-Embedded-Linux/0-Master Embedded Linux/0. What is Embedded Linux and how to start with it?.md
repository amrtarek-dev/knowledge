Embedded Linux is a specialised version of the Linux operating system that is designed to run on embedded devices such as microcontrollers, microprocessors, and single-board computers. 

These devices have limited resources like memory, processing power, and storage, and they are used in a wide range of applications like home automation, automotive, medical devices, and industrial control systems.
## Start with Embedded Linux
Embedded Linux is designed to run on small, resource-constrained devices such as embedded systems, mobile phones, routers, and other electronic devices. It is a popular choice for developers due to its open-source nature, customisable architecture, and broad community support, and it is typically composed of hardware and software components, including **microcontrollers** or **microprocessors**, **memory**, storage, and **various** peripherals such as **sensors**, **cameras**, and **displays** as hardware components and the software components include the **Linux kernel**, **boot loader**, **device drivers**, **application software**, and **middleware**.

To start with Embedded Linux, you need to have a good understanding of the Linux operating system, C programming language, and hardware architecture. 

Here are some steps to get started with Embedded Linux:

### 1. Linux basics
Familiarise yourself with the basics of Linux, including the command-line interface, file system structure, processes, system calls and package management.

### 2. C programming:
Embedded Linux development mostly uses the C programming language, so it is essential to learn C programming fundamentals and data structures.

### 3. Install Linux on the hardware platform:
You can download a pre-built Embedded Linux image or build your own image using tools like **Build-root** or **Yocto** Project and run it on various hardware platforms, such as Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, and others. Choose a platform that meets your requirements and budget.

### 4. Study Linux kernel:
Learn about the Linux System Architecture including the kernel, user space, device drivers, boot loader including U-Boot, GRUB, and EFI, and how they boot the Linux kernel, kernel Internals including kernel data structures, process management, memory management, and device drivers and how to build and customise the kernel for your specific hardware platform.

### 5. Explore development tools:
Embedded Linux development involves using different tools, such as compilers, debuggers, cross-compilers, and emulators. Learn how to set up the development environment and use these tools efficiently.

### 6. Develop Embedded Linux applications:
Once you have gained fundamental knowledge of Embedded Linux development, start developing applications including using libraries and tools such as Qt, GTK, and GStreamer, and integrating them with the kernel.

## What are the positions in Embedded Linux?

There are various positions in the field of Embedded Linux, depending on the level of expertise, experience, and responsibilities.

Here are some of the common positions in the field of Embedded Linux:

### Embedded Linux Developer:
An Embedded Linux Developer is responsible for developing and maintaining the Embedded Linux kernel, drivers, and applications. They should have a deep understanding of the Linux kernel, C programming language, and Embedded Linux development tools.

### Embedded Linux Engineer:
An Embedded Linux Engineer is responsible for designing and developing Embedded Linux-based systems, including hardware, software, and firmware components. They should have experience in hardware design, board bring-up, and system integration.

### Embedded Linux Systems Administrator:
An Embedded Linux Systems Administrator is responsible for maintaining and managing the Embedded Linux-based systems, including software updates, security, and performance optimization.

### Embedded Linux Tester:
An Embedded Linux Tester is responsible for testing and verifying the Embedded Linux-based systems' functionality, reliability, and performance. They should have experience in automated testing, regression testing, and test plan development.

### Embedded Linux Architect:
An Embedded Linux Architect is responsible for designing and implementing Embedded Linux-based solutions, including system architecture, software design, and hardware integration. They should have experience in system-level design, optimization, and performance analysis.

### Embedded Linux Technical Support:
An Embedded Linux Technical Support Specialist provides technical support to customers using Embedded Linux-based products, including troubleshooting, bug-fixing, and customer training.

These are just some of the common positions in the field of Embedded Linux. The exact responsibilities and requirements may vary depending on the company, industry, and specific project requirements.

Overall, Embedded Linux positions require a solid understanding of Linux kernel architecture, C programming, device drivers, and system-level software development.
