The linux Kernel needs a file system, called a **root filesystem**, at startup.

It contains the configuration file needed to prepare the execution environment for the application (e.g setting up the Ethernet address), and the first user-level process (init).

## Root filesystem location:
- A portion of the RAM (initial ram disk (initrd))
In case the embedded system does not need to store data persistently during its operation.
- On persistent storage
or on a persistent storage if the system needs to store data persistently during its operation.
- On storage over network
if developing a linux based embedded system
