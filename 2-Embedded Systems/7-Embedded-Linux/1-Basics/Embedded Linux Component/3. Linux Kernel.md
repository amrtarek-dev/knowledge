The linux kernel is the software responsible for optimally managing the embedded system's hardware resources.

It offers a range of services that perform a variety of essential functions for the operating system such as:
- Process management
- Process scheduling (Task schedulers)
- Inter-process communication (IPC)
	- By sockets or shared memory
- Memory management
- I/O management (device drivers)
- File system
- Networking
	- Network management (Network Protocol, device drivers)
- And more...

Linux kernel adopts a layered operating system architecture, the operating system is divided into two layers:
- User space
- Kernel space
User space and kernel space are different address spaces.
Kernel space is delivering the basic services by a single executable (Monolithic Kernel), but this services can be extended at run-time by using the **loadable Kernel modules**.

Advantage:
- Good separation between application/system programs and kernel.
- Bugs in the user space do not corrupt the kernel.
Disadvantage:
- Bugs in one kernel component (e.g. a new device driver) can crash the whole system.
