- Bootloader
- Device tree
- linux Kernel
- Root File System

## Bootloader
it is a software executed at power-up to set-up the hardware to run the operating system

## Device tree
It is a data tree structure with nodes that describe the physical devices in the hardware needed by the Linux Kernel to initialize properly the device drivers.

## Linux Kernel
The Operating System code providing all the services to manage the hardware resource and many other tasks.

## Root File System
It is a container for the Linux Kernel configuration files, the system programs and the Application.

### System Programs:
It is a part of the Root file system which is user-friendly utilities to access operating system services.

### Application
It is a part of the Root file system which is a software implementing the functionalities to be delivered to the embedded system user.
