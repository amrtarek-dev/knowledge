The metadata for the Yocto Project is structured into layers, by convention, each with a name beginning with `meta`.
The core layers of the Yocto Project are:
- meta: The OpenEmbedded
- meta-yocto: Metadata specific to the Yocto project (Poky distribution)
- meta-yocto-bsp: The board-support-package for the reference machines that Yocto project supports.

There is a useful list of layers at http://layers.openembedded.org. Here are some examples:
- **meta-angstrom**: The Ångström distribution
- **meta-qt5**: Qt5 libraries and utilities
- **meta-fsl-arm**: BSPs for Freescale ARM-based SoCs
- **meta-fsl-ppc**: BSPs for Freescale PowerPC-based SoCs
- **meta-intel**: BSPs for Intel CPUs and SoCs
- **meta-ti**: BSPs for TI ARM-based SoCs

### Create Layer
Each meta layer has to have at least one configuration file `conf/layer.conf` , 
and should also have a `README` file and a `license`.
to create layer you can use the `yocto-layer` script to create one:
``` bash
cd poky
scripts/bitbake-layers create-layer nova

# Please enter the layer priority you'd like to use for the layer: [default: 6]
# Would you like to have an example recipe created? (y/n) [default: n]
# Would you like to have an example bbappend file created? (y/n) [default: n]
# New layer created in meta-nova.
# Don't forget to add it to your BBLAYERS (for details see meta-nova\README).
```
Where `nova` is the layer name, so this will create a new directory with `meta-nova` name, with MIT license in `COPYING.MIT`, and `conf/layer.conf` which looks like:
``` bash
# We have a conf and classes directory, add to BBPATH
BBPATH .= ":${LAYERDIR}"

# We have recipes-* directories, add to BBFILES
BBFILES += "${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bb \
${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bbappend"

BBFILE_COLLECTIONS += "nova"
BBFILE_PATTERN_nova = "^${LAYERDIR}/"
BBFILE_PRIORITY_nova = "6"
```
The last step you need is to add the layer to the image that you want to build by editing the `build/conf/bblayers.conf`
``` bash
LCONF_VERSION = "6"

BBPATH = "${TOPDIR}"
BBFILES ?= ""

BBLAYERS ?= " \
	/home/amr/poky/meta \
	/home/amr/poky/meta-yocto \
	/home/amr/poky/meta-yocto-bsp \
	/home/amr/poky/meta-nova \
	"

BBLAYERS_NON_REMOVABLE ?= " \
	/home/amr/poky/meta \
	/home/amr/poky/meta-yocto \
	"
```

You can list all added layers by running command:
``` bash
bitbake-layers show-layers
```
