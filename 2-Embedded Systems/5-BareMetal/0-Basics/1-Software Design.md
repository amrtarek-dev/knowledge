In bare metal development, software design is structured to maximize efficiency, performance, and direct control over hardware. Since there's no operating system, the design must handle all system responsibilities manually. This includes managing hardware resources, interrupts, memory, and execution flow. Below are the key components of software design for bare metal development.

### 1. **Modular Code Structure**

Bare metal systems are often resource-constrained, so the software should be highly modular to facilitate maintainability, reuse, and optimization. Key modules include:

- **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**: Interfaces directly with the hardware, providing a more readable interface for upper layers.
- **Peripheral Drivers**: Handles specific hardware components such as GPIOs, timers, and communication protocols (I2C, SPI, UART).
- **Application Layer**: Contains the main logic of the application (e.g., controlling sensors or actuators).

This layered approach simplifies debugging, testing, and future expansion.
``` c
// HAL for GPIO
void gpio_init(void);
void gpio_write(uint8_t pin, uint8_t value);
```

### 2. **Startup Code**

The software design typically begins with **startup code** that:

- Configures the **stack pointer**.
- Sets up the **interrupt vector table**.
- Initializes system clocks and peripherals.
- Calls the main function.

The startup code is usually provided by hardware vendors, but it can also be customized.
The startup code typically includes:

- System clock configuration
- Setting the vector table for interrupts
- Jumping to the `main()` function

``` assembly
// Simple ARM Cortex-M startup code
Reset_Handler:
    LDR   R0, =_stack_top   // Load stack pointer
    LDR   R1, =main         // Load address of main()
    BX    R1                // Jump to main
```

### 3. **Main Loop Design (Super Loop)**

Since there's no OS to manage tasks, many bare metal systems rely on a **super loop** design. The **main loop** repeatedly executes the program's core logic in a continuous cycle. It checks for events (like sensor data or button presses) and executes corresponding actions.

```c
int main(void) {
    init_peripherals();  // Initialize hardware peripherals

    while (1) {
        read_sensor_data();  // Read sensors
        process_actuators();  // Control actuators
        handle_communication();  // Communicate data if needed
    }
}
```

This super loop is simple but can become inefficient for complex applications.

### 4. **Interrupt-Driven Design**

To handle asynchronous events efficiently (e.g., sensor readings or communication interrupts), you can design the system to rely on **interrupts**. An interrupt-driven design allows the processor to respond quickly to events without continuously polling in the main loop, improving system responsiveness.

``` c
void EXTI0_IRQHandler(void) {
    if (button_pressed()) {
        toggle_led();  // Action triggered by interrupt
    }
    EXTI->PR |= (1 << 0);  // Clear the interrupt flag
}
```

### 5. **Memory Management**

In bare metal systems, memory management is manual:

- **Static allocation** is preferred to avoid the complexity of dynamic memory management.
- You will use a **linker script** to define memory sections (e.g., code in Flash, variables in RAM).
- Proper handling of **stack** and **heap** is necessary to prevent memory corruption or stack overflows.

``` ld
MEMORY {
    FLASH (rx) : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 128K
    RAM (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 20K
}

SECTIONS {
    .text : { *(.text*) } > FLASH
    .data : { *(.data*) } > RAM
}
```

### 6. **State Machine Design**

For more complex applications, using a **state machine** design can improve code organization and flow control. This approach breaks down the system into states (e.g., idle, processing, error handling) and transitions between them based on events or conditions.

``` c
typedef enum {
    STATE_IDLE,
    STATE_PROCESSING,
    STATE_ERROR
} system_state_t;

system_state_t current_state = STATE_IDLE;

void update_state(event_t event) {
    switch (current_state) {
        case STATE_IDLE:
            if (event == EVENT_START)
                current_state = STATE_PROCESSING;
            break;
        case STATE_PROCESSING:
            if (event == EVENT_ERROR)
                current_state = STATE_ERROR;
            break;
        case STATE_ERROR:
            if (event == EVENT_RESET)
                current_state = STATE_IDLE;
            break;
    }
}

```

### 7. **Low-Power Modes**

Embedded systems often need to conserve power. Bare metal software designs typically include handling for **low-power modes**, which put the microcontroller into sleep or standby states when itâ€™s idle, waking up on interrupts.

``` c
void enter_sleep_mode(void) {
    __WFI();  // Wait for interrupt, putting CPU in low-power mode
}

int main(void) {
    setup();  // Set up peripherals and interrupts

    while (1) {
        if (is_idle()) {
            enter_sleep_mode();  // Sleep until an interrupt occurs
        }
    }
}
```

### 8. **Error Handling and Debugging**

Bare metal systems need robust error-handling mechanisms. Common methods include:

- **Watchdog timers**: Ensure the system resets if it enters an undefined state.
- **Fault handlers**: Respond to critical hardware faults (e.g., bus faults, memory access violations).
- **Debugging interfaces**: Use tools like **SWD** or **JTAG** for real-time debugging of hardware states.

### 9. **Timing and Scheduling**

In the absence of an OS, software can implement simple timing mechanisms using:

- **Timers**: Set up hardware timers for periodic tasks (e.g., reading sensor data every second).
- **Delay functions**: For basic time intervals, though they can be inefficient for precise timing.

A bare metal design may also implement **cooperative scheduling** if multiple tasks need to run concurrently.

``` c
void TIM2_IRQHandler(void) {
    if (TIM2->SR & TIM_SR_UIF) {  // Check for update interrupt flag
        TIM2->SR &= ~TIM_SR_UIF;  // Clear the flag
        toggle_led();
    }
}

void init_timer(void) {
    RCC->APB1ENR |= RCC_APB1ENR_TIM2EN;  // Enable TIM2 clock
    TIM2->PSC = 16000 - 1;  // Prescaler (assuming 16MHz clock)
    TIM2->ARR = 1000 - 1;   // Auto-reload value for 1Hz interrupt
    TIM2->DIER |= TIM_DIER_UIE;  // Enable update interrupt
    TIM2->CR1 |= TIM_CR1_CEN;    // Start the timer
}

```
