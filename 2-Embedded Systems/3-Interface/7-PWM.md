**Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** is a technique where a digital signal switches between on and off states with a certain duty cycle, which represents the analog value. 
It's often used for controlling motors, dimming LEDs, and generating variable voltages.

PWM varies the width of pulses in a fixed frequency to simulate a variable analog level. For instance, a 50% duty cycle gives an effective voltage that is half the system voltage when averaged over time.

## Duty cycle
The duty cycle represents the percentage of time the signal is "on" during each cycle. For example, if the duty cycle is 50%, the signal is on for half of the time and off for the other half.
A higher duty cycle (e.g., 75%) means the signal is on more of the time, providing a higher average voltage. Conversely, a lower duty cycle (e.g., 25%) provides a lower average voltage.
## Frequency
The frequency of the PWM signal is the rate at which the pulse cycles between on and off states.
The frequency must be high enough that the load, like a motor or LED, doesn't respond to the rapid switching but instead sees a steady effect due to the average voltage.

## Resolution
PWM resolution depends on the number of possible duty cycle steps.
A higher resolution allows more precise control over the output.

## Analog Control
By adjusting the duty cycle, PWM approximates different voltage levels. For example, if the digital signal switches between 0V and 5V, a 50% duty cycle averages out to 2.5V over time.
This approximation allows PWM to control devices that are typically adjusted with analog signals.

## Applications
PWM is widely used in embedded systems and electronics for applications that require variable control:
- **Motor Speed Control**: By varying the duty cycle, the average power sent to a DC motor changes, controlling its speed.
- **LED Brightness Control**: PWM can adjust the brightness of an LED by changing how long itâ€™s on relative to being off within each cycle.
- **Audio Signal Generation**: PWM is sometimes used in audio systems to generate or control sound levels.
- **Power Regulation**: PWM can manage power delivery efficiently, making it a popular choice for switching power supplies and voltage regulators.
