Embedded C is a specialised version of the C programming language designed for developing software for embedded systems that include:
- direct interaction with hardware, such as reading and writing to specific memory addresses to control peripherals like sensors and actuators.
- Efficient in terms of both speed and memory usage.
- Low-level operations, such as bit manipulation and direct hardware access
- Involves writing hardware-specific code and using device-specific libraries.
- Involves specialised tools such as cross-compilers (compilers that run on a different platform than the code they generate), debuggers, and in-circuit emulators.

Here is an example of toggle an AVR microcontroller pin, using super loop design.
```c
#include <avr/io.h>
#define F_CPU 16000000UL
#include <util/delay.h>

int main(void) {
    // Set PORTB5 as output
    DDRB |= (1 << DDB5);
    
    while (1) {
        // Toggle PORTB5
        PORTB ^= (1 << PORTB5);
        _delay_ms(1000);  // Delay for 1000 milliseconds
    }
    
    return 0;
}

```
