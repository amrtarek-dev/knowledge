SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a synchronous serial communication protocol commonly used in embedded systems for short-distance, high-speed data transfer between a master device (like a microcontroller) and one or more peripheral devices (e.g., sensors, memory chips).
- Serial - wired
- Synchronized
- Full duplex communication

## Connection
SPI is master slave communication

- **Master**: The main controller that initiates communication and provides the clock signal.
- **Slave**: One or more peripheral devices that respond to the master.
- **SPI Bus Lines**:
    - **MOSI (Master Out, Slave In)**: Transmits data from master to slave.
    - **MISO (Master In, Slave Out)**: Transmits data from slave to master.
    - **SCK (Serial Clock)**: Clock signal generated by the master to synchronize data transfers.
    - **SS (Slave Select)**: A line that enables communication with specific slaves, managed by the master to select one slave at a time.

## Protocol
- SPI is a full-duplex protocol, meaning data can be sent and received simultaneously.
- Communication is controlled by the master device, which generates the clock signal (SCK).
- Data is transferred in "frames," which are typically 8 bits, though other lengths are also supported depending on the system.
- The SS line ensures that only the selected slave participates in the communication, which can be managed in either:
    - **Single Master-Slave Communication**: One master and one slave; simpler setup with only one SS line needed.
    - **Multi-Slave Configuration**: Multiple slaves connected to a single master, requiring separate SS lines for each slave.
## Mode of Communication
- **Single Master-Slave Mode**: One master communicates with one slave.
- **Multi-Slave Mode**: One master can communicate with multiple slaves by toggling their SS lines individually.
- **Daisy-Chain Mode**: Useful for devices that support chaining. Data passes from one slave to the next in a sequence, reducing the need for multiple SS lines.
